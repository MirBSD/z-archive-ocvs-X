@update to evilwm 0.99.14
@
text
@There is currently no support in the binary for multiheaded systems.
To run evilwm on such a system, you'll need to do a little extra work,
and put up with some niggles.

CODE

In your .xinitrc, instead of a single line spawning evilwm, use
something like:

for x in 0 1 2; do
	DISPLAY=:0.$x evilwm &
	DISPLAY=:0.$x xterm -geometry +0+0 &
done

NIGGLES

The reason I put an xterm in that for loop is that you need something
to get focus from.  If you move the mouse from one screen to the next,
focus will remain with whatever had it last until you move the mouse
over a client window.  It doesn't have to be an xterm, you just have to
make sure you have one client on each screen.

For the same reason, if you've compiled the virtual desktop version
(using -DVWM), it's a good idea to ensure that at least one client per
screen is 'fixed' to stop yourself accidentally losing focus and having
to manually start stuff (with eg DISPLAY=:0.x xeyes &) to regain it.

Have fun,

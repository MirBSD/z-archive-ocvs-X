@BUILDING EVILWM

1) Edit Makefile to suit what you want.  Instructions are included by any
   user-editable option.

2) Run 'make'

OR, run 'make allinone' - this will cat all the source files into a
single file for compilation, which gives the compiler more chance to
inline some functions (read: faster, probably smaller in this case).

3) Run 'make install'

That's it.  The README file has information on starting evilwm.

* Solid window drags.
* Virtual desktops.
* Small binary size.

Installation instructions for evilwm
------------------------------------
(for Debian package build instructions, page down a bit)

1) Edit Makefile to suit what you want.

Basically you edit the DEFINES line and enable the features you want:

* -DMOUSE	Enable mouse support.  You probably want this.
* -DSTDIO	Enable certain text messages like help.  You want this too
		unless you *really* want to trim the bytes.
* -DSOLIDDRAG	Enable solid window drags.  This actually saves a bit of
		space due to less calls to the outline drawing routine.
		It doesn't affect resizes - they will still block.
* -DVWM		Enable virtual desktop support.  See README for details.
* -VDESK	Enable usage of the external pager "vdesk" instead of the
		builtin virtual desktops. See README for details.
* -DCOLOURMAP	Enable colourmap handling.  It's only needed for non-truecolour
		displays (and if you use the mouse you might find it's fine
		even then).
* -DDEBUG	Print whatever debugging messages I've left in this release.

Edit the prefix line if you don't want it installed under /usr/X11R6.

Creating a Debian package
-------------------------

1) Become root.

2) Run 'dpkg-buildpackage'

Which is part of dpkg-dev, and will need debhelper.

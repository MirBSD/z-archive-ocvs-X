@* use window's hints as the account to be resized by by default,
  not a fixed value of 16 (thanks to ciruz (Jonathan Schleifer) for
  mentioning this value exists)
* move check if hints are <1 to after all hints have been received
  from the X server and application (could have been overridden)
* don't let the user resize a window by keyboard to less than one
  (1) pixel width and height
* update licence template

@evilwm is a minimalist window manager for the X Window System.

Features:
* No window decorations apart from a simple 1 pixel border.
* No icons.
* Good keyboard control, including repositioning and maximise toggles.
* Solid window drags.
* Virtual desktops.
* Small binary size.

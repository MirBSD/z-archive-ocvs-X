@Post-installation instructions for XFree86[tm] on MirBSD/i386
-------------------------------------------------------------

Conventions used in this document:
  - somename(1) implies that 'somename' is a program, and there is a manual
    page available in section 1 of the manual pages for further reading,
    viewed by typing "man 1 somename".

1. Make sure your system has support for X enabled:

   You must have 'option APERTURE' in your kernel configuration and
   uncomment the line that says:

        machdep.allowaperture=1

   or

        machdep.allowaperture=2

   in /etc/sysctl.conf.  See xf86(4) for more details about security
   issues related to this.  After changing this variable in sysctl.conf,
   you will need to reboot for the change to take effect. Most drivers for
   XFree86 XFree4 servers require this value to be set to 2, while
   drivers for XFree86 3.3.6 require it only to be set to 1.

2. Find out about your hardware:

   Find out what chipset is used by your video board.  Write this
   information down. The dmesg(8) command output is useful.

   You need to decide if you can use the XFree86 XFree4 server,
   XFree86(1), or if you have some legacy VGA card supported only by
   one of the old XFree86 3.3.6 servers - in which case there is no
   support in MirBSD.

   See http://www.xfree86.org/XFree4/Status.html for specific details.

   What kind of mouse do you have and which port is it connected to?
   The 2 most common cases are a PS/2 style or USB mouse, for which
   MirBSD uses the NetBSD wsmouse(4) protocol with the /dev/wsmouse device.
   If you have a serial mouse, connected to /dev/tty00 (MS Windows
   COM1: port) or /dev/tty01 (COM2: port) you probably want to try the
   'auto' protocol first.

3. Create the XF86Config(5) file for your server.

    * For the XFree86 XFree4 server, run xf86cfg(1) or xf86config(1).

       - Usage of xf86config(1) is preferred, because xf86cfg(1)
         is known to produce problems.
       - This will produce the /etc/X11/XF86Config file.
       - This will create /usr/X11R6/bin/X as a link to XFree86.
       - If for some reason xf86cfg(1) doesn't work on your hardware, try
         using the text mode by typing "xf86cfg -textmode", or try the
         alternate program, xf86config(1).

       See the XFree86 XFree4 documentation available at:

              /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc/

4. Start either xdm(1) or startx(1).

   a. Start xdm(1), the X display manager by activating the xdm_flags option
      in /etc/rc.conf(8) or /etc/rc.conf.local(8).  You do not need to disable
      the console getty.

   b. Start startx(1) from a console shell.  It is the X script that starts
      the X server and a few X applications, including a window manager.

5. With XFree86 XFree4, you can use antialiased fonts in some applications.
   visit http://www.openbsd.org/faq/truetype.html for more information.

   You must choose one of option a or b below.  If one does not work, try the
   other.  Please note the location of the XF86Config file listed below.  Both
   the location and the utilities that generate them are different.  You will
   not have great success mixing XFree86 XFree4 XF86Config(5) files with
   XFree86 3.3.6 XF86Config(5) files.

    a. For the XFree86 XFree4 server, run xf86cfg(1) or xf86config(1).
d49 2
a60 14
    b. For the XFree86 3.3.6 server, run XF86Setup(1) or xf86config3(1).

       - This will make the /etc/XF86Config file.
       - This will create /usr/X11R6/bin/X as a link to your XF86_* server,
         one of the XFree86 3.3.6 servers listed in item 2 above.
       - If for some reason XF86Setup(1) doesn't work on your hardware, try
         the alternate program xf86config3(1).

       See the XF86Config user's guide for XFree86 3.3.6 servers at:

              /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc/XFree86-3.3.6/QuickStart.doc

   For manual configuration information, see XF86Config-3(5).

because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

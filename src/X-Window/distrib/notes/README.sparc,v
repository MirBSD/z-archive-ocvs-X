@Post-installation instructions for XFree86 on OpenBSD/sparc
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. Sun setup is easy:

   Typical XFree86 use on Sun sparc-based machines requires no special
   configuration.  The provided /etc/X11/XF86Config will work in most
   setups.

   However, multi-headed configurations will require some changes to this
   file. Starting from the existing /etc/X11/XF86Config, three additional
   sections are added for the second framebuffer:

	Section "Device"
		Identifier      "Wsdisplay1"
		Driver          "wsfb"
		Option          "device" "/dev/ttyD0"
	EndSection

	Section "Monitor"
		Identifier   "Monitor1"
		VendorName   "Unknown"
		ModelName    "Unknown"
	# Adjust those to your monitor before using another device than wsfb
	# or you can destroy it !!
		HorizSync    31.5-60
		VertRefresh  50-70
	EndSection

	Section "Screen"
		Identifier "Screen1"
		Device     "Wsdisplay1"
		Monitor    "Monitor1"
		SubSection "Display"
			Depth     1
		EndSubSection
		SubSection "Display"
			Depth     8
		EndSubSection
		SubSection "Display"
			Depth     16
		EndSubSection
		SubSection "Display"
			Depth     24
		EndSubSection
		SubSection "Display"
			Depth     32
		EndSubSection
	EndSection
   
   The ServerLayout section is also changed to include the second framebuffer
   and its logical location relative to the first, eg:

	Section "ServerLayout"
		Identifier	"wsfb"
		Screen  0       "Screen0"
		Screen  1       "Screen1" RightOf "Screen0"
		InputDevice	"zsmouse0" "CorePointer"
		InputDevice	"Keyboard0" "CoreKeyboard"
	EndSection

   See XF86Config(5) for more options.

2. Start either xdm(1) or startx(1).

   a. Start xdm(1), the X display manager by activating the xdm_flags option
      in /etc/rc.conf(8) or /etc/rc.conf.local(8).  You do not need to disable
      the console getty.

   b. Start startx(1) from a console shell.  It is the X script that starts
      the X server and a few X applications, including a window manager.

@sparc has to die :(

it was nice while it lasted, but I couldn't even live up to
my promise to provide XFree86 4.4.0 on sparc due to lack of
time (and money and health).

also, compat_freebsd dies, without prejudice.

<mirabile> benz: sparc darf sterben?
<mirabile> compat_freebsd darf sterben?
<benz> na gut

in addition, some set shuffling (it was a good idea originally
to pull out gcc3 specifics to the egcs set, but with gcc3 being
the only compiler that isn't it any more)

@this is my idea of a fine i386 b-r of base and X-Window.
features correcting of permissions in X-Window, and
estimated set sizes (compressed/uncompressed) overall,
as well as a better (still bad) checkflist for X.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

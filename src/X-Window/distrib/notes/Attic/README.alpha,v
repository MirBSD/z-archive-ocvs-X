@Post-installation instructions for XFree86 on OpenBSD/alpha
-----------------------------------------------------------

OpenBSD 3.2 and later uses the XFree86 X server on alpha. 

Currently, TGA video hardware as well as a few VGA cards are
supported.

A special driver reproduces the functionnality of Xtga in previous
releases:  wsfb. It uses the TGA as a dumb framebuffer at 8 or 24 bits
per pixels, depending on the card model. 
A default /etc/X11/XF86Config is installed that uses this driver. So
you can just use 'startx' or xdm to start X without further
configuration. 

VGA cards support is available only on BWX based machines.
The following cards have been successfully tested for now:

* 3DFX Interactive Banshee
* 3DLabs Permedia 2 (8, 15, 16 and 24 bits depth) 
* ATI Rage Pro (works with 'Option "NoAccel"')
* ATI Rage 128
* Cirrus Logic CL5430 (works with 'Option "NoAccel"')
* Cirrus Logic GD5446 (8, 16 and 24 bits depth)
* Matrox MGA 2064 (8, 16 and 24 bits depth)

Make sure your system has support for X enabled:

You must have 'option APERTURE' in your kernel configuration and
uncomment the line that says:  

	machdep.allowaperture=1

in /etc/sysctl.conf.  See xf86(4) for more details about security
issues related to this.  After changing this variable in sysctl.conf,
you will need to reboot for the change to take effect. 

See the tga(4) manual page for instructions on setting
the resolution of a TGA card.

Start either xdm(1) or startx(1).

   a. Start xdm(1), the X display manager by activating the xdm_flags option
      in /etc/rc.conf(8) or /etc/rc.conf.local(8).  You may need to disable
      the console getty.

   b. Start startx(1) from a console shell.  It is the X script that starts
      the X server and a few X applications, including a window manager.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

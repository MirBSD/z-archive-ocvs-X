@Post-installation instructions for XFree86 on OpenBSD/amd64
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. Make sure your system has support for X enabled:

   You must have 'option APERTURE' in your kernel configuration and
   uncomment the line that says:  

      machdep.allowaperture=2

   in /etc/sysctl.conf.  See xf86(4) for more details about security
   issues related to this.  After changing this variable in sysctl.conf,
   you will need to reboot for the change to take effect.

2. Find out about your hardware:

   Find out what chipset is used by your video board.  Write this
   information down. The dmesg(8) command output is useful.

   What kind of mouse do you have and which port is it connected to?
   The 2 most common cases are a PS/2 style mouse or a USB mouse , for
   which OpenBSD uses the wsmouse(4) protocol with the /dev/wsmouse
   device.

3. Create the XF86Config(5) file for your server.

   Run XFree86 -configure as root and move the resulting
   XF86Config.new file to /etc/X11/XF86Config. 
   If needed edit it to adust the keyboard and mouse settings. 

4. Start either xdm(1) or startx(1).

   a. Start xdm(1), the X display manager by activating the xdm_flags option
      in /etc/rc.conf(8) or /etc/rc.conf.local(8).  You do not need to disable
      the console getty.

   b. Start startx(1) from a console shell.  It is the X script that starts
      the X server and a few X applications, including a window manager.
 
5. With XFree86 XFree4, you can use antialiased fonts in some applications. 
   visit http://www.openbsd.org/faq/truetype.html for more information.

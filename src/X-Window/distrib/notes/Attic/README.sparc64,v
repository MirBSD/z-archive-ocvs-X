@Post-installation instructions for XFree86 on OpenBSD/sparc64

Single, unaccelerated display
-----------------------------
This setup is by far the easiest to configure and is supported on just
about every machine OpenBSD/sparc64 runs on (both PCI and SBus based
machines).  A sample /etc/X11/XF86Config is given at the end of this
section, but it may need to be customized to fit the machine.  Mostly
these just entails configuring where mouse input comes from.

- For systems with serial mice on Zilog ports (zstty), the following
'ServerLayout' section should be used in place of the one provided:

Section "ServerLayout"
	Identifier	"wsfb"
	Screen 0	"Screen0" 0 0
	InputDevice	"zsmouse0" "CorePointer"
	InputDevice	"Keyboard0" "CoreKeyboard"
EndSection

- For systems with serial mice on 'com' ports, the following
'ServerLayout' section should be used in place of the one provided:

Section "ServerLayout"
	Identifier	"wsfb"
	Screen 0	"Screen0" 0 0
	InputDevice	"commouse0" "CorePointer"
	InputDevice	"Keyboard0" "CoreKeyboard"
EndSection

- For systems with USB mice or PS/2 mice, the following 'ServerLayout'
section should be used in place of the one provided:

Section "ServerLayout"
	Identifier	"wsfb"
	Screen 0	"Screen0" 0 0
	InputDevice	"wsmouse0" "CorePointer"
	InputDevice	"Keyboard0" "CoreKeyboard"
EndSection

- For systems with both UPA and VGA framebuffers, the device parameter
in the "Device" section must match the wsdisplay device corresponding
to the console (/dev/ttyC0 for wsdisplay0, /dev/ttyD0 for wsdisplay1,
etc).

- For systems with UPA Creator/Creator3D/Elite3D framebuffers use 
	DefaultDepth 24
  in the "Screen" section.

- What follows is a  whole sample configuration file. Copy it to
  /etc/X11/XF86Config and customize it as described above.

Single, accelerated display
---------------------------
Accelerated access to the framebuffer is only supported on machines with
PCI VGA framebuffers.  To use it, retrieve the PCI bus, device and function
of the video card, eg:

	blade$ dmesg | grep vgafb
	vgafb0 at pci0 dev 19 function 0 "ATI Rage XL" rev 0x27
	wsdisplay0 at vgafb0: console (sun, sun emulation), using wskbd0

The framebuffer is on bus 0, device 19, function 0.  Now, using the
configuration in the first section as a guide, replace the "Device" section
with something like the following (replace 0:19:0 with the bus:dev:func
of the framebuffer):

	Section "Device"
		Identifier	"Card0"
		Driver		"ati"
		BusID		"PCI:0:19:0"
		Option		"composite_sync" "True"
	EndSection

It is also important that you modify the Monitor section and change the
HorizSync and VertRefresh parameters with those of the monitor in use.
Finally, customization of the Screen section will allow switching of
resolutions and setting the default bit depth, eg.:

Section "Screen"
	Identifier	"Screen0"
	Device		"Card0"
	Monitor		"Monitor"
	DefaultDepth	24
	SubSection "Display"
		Depth	8
		Modes	"640x480" "800x600" "1024x768"
	EndSubSection
	SubSection "Display"
		Depth	16
		Modes	"640x480" "800x600" "1024x768"
	EndSubSection
	SubSection "Display"
		Depth	24
		Modes	"640x480" "800x600" "1024x768"
	EndSubSection
EndSection

See XF86Config(5) for more options.

Dual, unaccelerated display
---------------------------
Dual-headed displays are only supported on machines with SBus cgsix(4) or
cgthree(4) framebuffers.  Starting with the configuration in the first
section, three additional sections are added for the second framebuffer:

Section "Device"
	Identifier      "Wsdisplay1"
	Driver          "wsfb"
	Option          "device" "/dev/ttyD0"
EndSection

Section "Monitor"
	Identifier   "Monitor1"
	VendorName   "Unknown"
	ModelName    "Unknown"
# Adjust those to your monitor before using another device than wsfb
# or you can destroy it !!
	HorizSync    31.5-60
	VertRefresh  50-70
EndSection

Section "Screen"
	Identifier "Screen1"
	Device     "Wsdisplay1"
	Monitor    "Monitor1"
	DefaultDepth 8
	SubSection "Display"
		Depth     8
	EndSubSection
	SubSection "Display"
		Depth     16
	EndSubSection
	SubSection "Display"
		Depth     24
	EndSubSection
EndSection

The ServerLayout section is also changed to include the second framebuffer
and its logical location relative to the first, eg:

Section "ServerLayout"
	Identifier	"wsfb"
	Screen  0       "Screen0"
	Screen  1       "Screen1" RightOf "Screen0"
	InputDevice	"zsmouse0" "CorePointer"
	InputDevice	"Keyboard0" "CoreKeyboard"
EndSection

See XF86Config(5) for more options.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

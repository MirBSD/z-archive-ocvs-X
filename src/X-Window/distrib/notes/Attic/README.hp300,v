@Post-installation instructions for XFree86 on OpenBSD/hp300
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. HP300 setup is easy:

Typical XFree86 use on HP300 machines requires no special configuration.
However, you will need to deal with the X11R5 X server provided in 1 of 2 ways

a) decompress all fonts:	cd /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts
                         	find . -name '*gz' -exec gzip -d '{}' ';'
b) run the X11R6 font server:	xfs
   then, either:
   1) point the Xserver to it:	X -fp tcp/localhost:7100
   2) add '-fp tcp/localhost:7100' to /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers:
	:0 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X -fp tcp/localhost:7100 vt05
      .. then start xdm as below.

2. Start xdm, the X display manager by activating the xdm_flags option
   in /etc/rc.conf.  You may need to disable the console getty.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

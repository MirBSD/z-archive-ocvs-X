@Post-installation instructions for XFree86 on OpenBSD/pegasos
-------------------------------------------------------------

OpenBSD 3.4 and later uses the XFree86 X server on pegasos. 

A special driver uses whatever graphics mode the console is set to (by
OpenFirmware) as a dumb unaccelerated framebuffer in 8 bits per pixel.
A default /etc/X11/XF86Config is installed that uses this driver.  So
you can just use 'startx' or xdm to start X without further
configuration.

To use xdm from rc.conf, it is necessary to disable /dev/ttyC0 in
/etc/ttys, change the 'status' of /dev/ttyC0 to 'off'.

Accelerated drivers
-------------------

The 'ati' driver is currently known to work on the pegasos.
Other cards are untested.

Use xf86config to build a /etc/X11/XF86Config file before starting 
the server for the first time. Or you can use the sample configuration
file appended below as a starting point. 

You need to set machdep.allowaperture to 2 in /etc/rc.securelevel in
order to be able to use the XFree86 accelerated drivers.

-- Cut Here for a sample /etc/X11/XF86Config to use with the ati driver ---

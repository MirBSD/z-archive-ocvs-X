@Post-installation instructions for XFree86 on OpenBSD/macppc
------------------------------------------------------------

OpenBSD 3.0 and later uses the XFree86 X server on macppc. 

A special driver reproduces the functionality of Xmacppc in previous 
releases: wsfb. It uses whatever graphics mode the console is set to 
(by Mac OS 9) as a dumb unaccelerated framebuffer in 8 bits per pixel. 
A default /etc/X11/XF86Config is installed that uses this driver.
So you can just use 'startx' or xdm to start X without further 
configuration. 

To use xdm from rc.conf, it is necessary to disable /dev/ttyC0 in
/etc/ttys, change the 'status' of /dev/ttyC0 to 'off'.

Accelerated drivers
-------------------

The 'ati' driver is currently known to work on the G4 Macs with ATI
Rage 128 cards. The Titanium PowerBook G4 and iBook work with the commented
settings in the below sample XF86Config.  The 'nv' driver has problems
on nVidia cards for now.  Other cards are untested.

Use xf86config to build a /etc/X11/XF86Config file before starting 
the server for the first time. Or you can use the sample configuration
file appended below as a starting point. 

You need to set machdep.allowaperture to 2 in /etc/sysctl.conf in
order to be able to use the XFree86 accelerated drivers.

Mousekeys (Or how to deal with a One Button Mouse)
--------------------------------------------------

Using the mousekeys feature of XFree86, it is possible to emulate
button2 and button3, since Apple does not seem to build hardware with
them. Other mouse operations can also be emulated using the keyboard.
To see the default key mappings, look at /etc/X11/xkb/compat/mousekeys.
These are not enabled by default.  It is necessary to bind a key to
the Pointer_EnableKeys action.  For the PBG4 a good setting for
this is using the Enter key next to or near the space bar (US keymap).
This can be bound by using the following xmodmap command.
--
xmodmap -e "keysym Mode_switch = Mode_switch Pointer_EnableKeys"
--
With xmodmap above run, <shift><ctrl><enter> (not return) will
toggle the Pointer_EnableKeys mode allowing the key to be
used either as a mouse action or as the real key.

For other keyboards/setups, both "Mode_switch" strings in the xmodmap
command can be changed to another key. xev(1) can be used to determine
the name associated with a key.

The following is a diff to the mousekeys file which simplifies
mousekey usage on the PBG4, It could be used with other keyboards,
this is not specific to the PBG4.  It changes the default mousekey
behavior of the keypad 0 and keypad Decimal (period) to act as mouse
button 2 and mouse button 3 respectively.

.SH Arguments
.\"
.IP \fIdpy\fR 15
Specifies the display screen on which the
Xv Server is to accept requests from Xv clients.  If the
display option is not specified, Xv uses the display screen
specified by your DISPLAY environment variable.  The display
option has the format hostname:number.  Using two colons
(::) instead of one (:) indicates that DECnet is to be used
for transport.
.IP \fIport\fR 15
Defines the port to which the still is outputed.
.IP \fId\fR 15
Defines the drawable from which the still is to be captured.
Pixmaps are currently not supported.
.IP \fIgc\fR 15
Defines the graphical context.  GC components are: 
.I subwindow-mode, 
.I clip-x-origin, 
.I clip-y-origin,
and 
.I clip-mask.
.IP \fIvx,vy,vw,vh\fR 15
Define the location and size of the destination video region 
into which the still is to be written.  \fIvx\fP and \fIvy\fP define the 
.I x and
.I y
coordinates of the upper-left corner of the video region; 
.I vw and
.I vh
define the width and height, in pixels, of the video region.
.IP \fIdx,dy,dw,dh\fR 15
Define the location and size of the source drawable from which the
still image is to be captured.  
.I dx and
.I dy 
define the 
.I x and
.I y 
coordinates of the upper-left corner of the drawable region; 
.I dw and 
.I dh 
define the width and height, in pixels, of the drawable region.
.\"
.SH Description
.\"
.PN XvGetStill 
captures a single frame of video from a drawable.  The 
position and size of the destination (video) rectangle is specified by \fIvx,
vy, vw\fR, and \fIvh\fR.  The position and size of the 
source (drawable) rectangle is
specified by \fIdx, dy, dw\fR, and \fIdh\fR.  
.PP
Drawable data is clipped to the bounds of the drawable, scaled to the
requested video region size (or the closest size supported) and
clipped to the bounds of the video encoding.  The contents of any region
not updated with drawable data is undefined.
.PP
./" If the still is successfully captured an XvVideoNotify event with
./" detail XvStill is generated for the drawable.
./" [mhs]: Not in this universe
If the port is grabbed
by another client, this request is ignored, and an XvVideoNotify event
with detail XvBusy is generated for the drawable.
.SH Returned Values
.IP [Success] 8
Returned if XvGetStill(3X) completed successfully.
.IP [XvBadExtension] 8
Returned if the Xv extension is unavailable.
.IP [XvBadAlloc] 8
Returned if XvGetStill(3X) failed to allocate memory to process
the request.
.SH Diagnostics
.IP [XvBadPort] 8
Generated if the requested port does not exist.
.IP [BadDrawable] 8
Generated if the requested drawable does not exist.
.IP [BadGC] 8
Generated if the requested graphics context does not exist.
.IP [BadAlloc] 8
Generated if there were insufficient resources to process the request.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@That's what OpenBSD will, probably, ship as XF4 in 3.5
their last sync against XFree86 4.3-current has been
imported into our vendor branch, too

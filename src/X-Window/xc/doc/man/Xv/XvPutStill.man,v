.SH Arguments
.\"
.IP \fIdpy\fR 15
Specifies the display screen on which the
Xv Server is to accept requests from Xv clients.  If the
display option is not specified, Xv uses the display screen
specified by your DISPLAY environment variable.  The display
option has the format hostname:number.  Using two colons
(::) instead of one (:) indicates that DECnet is to be used
for transport.
.IP \fIport\fR 15
Defines the port from which to get the still.
.IP \fId\fR 15
Defines the drawable into which the still is to be written.
Pixmaps are currently not supported.
.IP \fIgc\fR 15
Defines the graphical context.  
GC components are: 
.I subwindow-mode, 
.I clip-x-origin, 
.I clip-y-origin,
and 
.I clip-mask.
.IP \fIvx,vy,vw,vh\fR 15
Define the location and size of the video region
to be written.  \fIvx\fP and \fIvy\fP define the 
upper-left pixel of the region. \fIvw\fP and \fIvh\fP
define the width and height, in pixels, of the region.
.IP \fIdx,dy,dw,dh\fR 15
Define the location and size of the destination region into which the
still image is written.  \fIdx\fP and \fIdy\fP define the upper-left 
corner of the region. \fIdw\fP and \fIdh\fP
define the width and height, in pixels, of the region.
.\"
.SH Description
.\"
XvPutStill(3X) writes a single frame of video to a drawable.  
The position and size of the source (video) rectangle is specified by \fIvx,
vy, vw\fR, and \fIvh\fR.  The position and size of the destination (drawable)
rectangle is specified by \fIdx, dy, dw\fR, and \fIdh\fR.
.PP
Video data is clipped to the bounds of the video encoding, scaled to the
requested drawable region size (or the closest size supported) and
clipped to the bounds of the drawable.
.PP
If the port is grabbed by another client, this request is ignored, and
an XvVideoNotify event with detail XvBusy is generated for the
drawable.  If the port is not receiving a valid video signal a
VideoNotify event with detail XvHardError is generated for the drawable.
.\"
.SH Returned Values
.IP [Success] 8
Returned if XvPutStill(3X) completed successfully.
.IP [XvBadExtension] 8
Returned if the Xv extension is unavailable.
.IP [XvBadAlloc] 8
Returned if XvGetStill(3X) failed to allocate memory to process
the request.
.SH Diagnostics
.IP [XvBadPort] 8
Generated if the requested port does not exist.
.IP [BadDrawable] 8
Generated if the requested drawable does not exist.
.IP [BadGC] 8
Generated if the requested graphics context does not exist.
.IP [BadAlloc] 8
Generated if there were insufficient resources to process the request.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

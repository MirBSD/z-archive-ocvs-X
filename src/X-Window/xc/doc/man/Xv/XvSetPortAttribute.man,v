.SH Name
XvSetPortAttribute \- sets an attribute of a video port

.SH Arguments
.\"
.IP \fIdpy\fR 15
Specifies the display screen on which the
Xv Server is to accept requests from Xv clients.  If the
display option is not specified, Xv uses the display screen
specified by your DISPLAY environment variable.  The display
option has the format hostname:number.  Using two colons
(::) instead of one (:) indicates that DECnet is to be used
for transport.
.IP \fIport\fR 15
Specifies the port for which the attribute is to be used.
.IP \fIattribute\fR 15
Identifies the port attribute to be set by this request.
Can be one of the table entries under the column "String," below.
.IP \fIvalue\fR 15
Identifies the value to which \fIattribute\fP is to be set.
Can be one of the table entries under the column "Type," below.

XvSetPortAttribute(3X) permits a client to set the port attribute
to specified values.  This request supports the following values:

.PP
The supplied encoding must be one of the encodings listed for the
adaptor, otherwise an Encoding error results.
.PP
If the adaptor does not support the exact hue, saturation,
brightness, and contrast levels supplied, the closest levels
supported are assumed.  Use XvGetPortAttribute(3X) 
to query the resulting levels.
.PP
When an XvSetPortAttribute(3X) request is processed, a 
PortControlNotify(3X) event is generated for all clients 
that have requested for port changes using XvSelectPortNotify(3X).
.SH Returned Values
.IP [Success] 8
Returned if XvSetPortAttribute(3X) completed successfully.
.IP [XvBadExtension] 8
Returned if the Xv extension is unavailable.
.IP [XvBadAlloc] 8
Returned if XvSelectVideoNotify(3X) failed to allocate memory to process
the request.
.SH Diagnostics
.IP [XvBadPort] 8
Generated if the requested port does not exist.
.IP [XvBadEncoding] 8
Generated if an encoding is specified that does not exist.
.IP [BadMatch] 8
Generated if the requested attribute atom does not specify an attribute 
supported by the adaptor.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

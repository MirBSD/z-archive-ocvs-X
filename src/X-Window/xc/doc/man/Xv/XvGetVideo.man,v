.SH Arguments
.\"
.IP \fIdpy\fR 15
Specifies the display screen on which the
Xv Server is to accept requests from Xv clients.  If the
display option is not specified, Xv uses the display screen
specified by your DISPLAY environment variable.  The display
option has the format hostname:number.  Using two colons
(::) instead of one (:) indicates that DECnet is to be used
for transport.
.IP \fIport\fR 15
Defines the port to which video output is sent.
.IP \fId\fR 15
Defines the drawable (window) from which video output is to be obtained.
.IP \fIgc\fR 15
Defines the graphical context.  GC components are: 
.I subwindow-mode, 
.I clip-x-origin, 
.I clip-y-origin,
and 
.I clip-mask.
.IP \fIvx,vy,vw,vh\fR 15
Define the location and size of the video region is to be written.  \fIvx\fP 
and \fIvy\fP define the 
.I x and
.I y
coordinates of the upper-left corner of the video region; 
.I vw and
.I vh
define the width and height, in pixels, of the video region.
.IP \fIdx,dy,dw,dh\fR 15
Define the location of the source drawable from which the
video image is to be taken.  
.I dx and
.I dy 
define the 
.I x and
.I y 
coordinates of the upper-left corner of the drawable region; 
.I dw and 
.I dh 
define the width and height, in pixels, of the drawable region.
.br
.SH Description
.PN XvGetVideo
outputs video from a drawable.  The position
and size of the destination rectangle is specified by 
.I vx,
.I vy, 
.I vw, 
and 
.I vh.  
The position and size of the source rectangle is specified by 
.I dx, 
.I dy, 
.I dw, 
and 
.I dh.
.PP
Drawable data is clipped to the bounds of the drawable, scaled to the
requested video region size (or the closest size supported) and
clipped to the bounds of the video encoding.  The contents of any region
not updated with drawable data is undefined.
.PP
If video is successfully initiated, an XvVideoNotify event with
detail XvStarted is generated for the drawable.  If the port is
already in use, its video is preempted, and if the new drawable is
different than the old, an XvVideoNotify event with detail XvPreempted
is generated for the old drawable.  If the port is grabbed by another
client, this request is ignored, and an XvVideoNotify event with detail
XvBusy is generated for the drawable.

.SH Returned Values
.IP [Success] 8
Returned if XvGetVideo(3X) completed successfully.
.IP [XvBadExtension] 8
Returned if the Xv extension is unavailable.
.IP [XvBadAlloc] 8
Returned if XvGetVideo(3X) failed to allocate memory to process
the request.
.SH Diagnostics
.IP [XvBadPort] 8
Generated if the requested port does not exist.

Generated if the requested graphics context does not exist.
.IP [BadDrawable] 8

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-
# butor be held liable for any damage, directly or indirectly, that origina-

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

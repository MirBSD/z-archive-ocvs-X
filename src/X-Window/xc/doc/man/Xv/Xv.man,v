.SH Name
Xv \- X Window System video extension
.SH Description
The Xv extension provides support for video adaptors attached to an X
display.  It takes the approach that a display may have one or more
video adaptors, each of which has one or more ports through which
independent video streams pass.  
.PP
An adaptor may be able to display video in a drawable, capture video
from a drawable, or both.  It translates between video encoding (NTSC,
PAL, SECAM, etc...) and drawable format (depth and visual-id pair). An
adaptor may support multiple video encodings and/or multiple drawable
formats.
.PP
Clients use Xv(3X) to gain access and manage sharing of a display's
video resources.  Typically, a client will use XvQueryExtension(3X) to
determine the status of the extension, XvQueryAdaptors(3X) to get a
description of what video adaptors exist, and XvQueryEncodings(3X) to
get a description of what video encodings an adaptor supports.
.PP
Once a client has determined what video resources are available, it is
free to put video into a drawable or get video from a drawable,
according the capabilities supported.  Clients can select to receive
events when video activity changes in a drawable and when port
attributes have changed.
.SH Summary of Library Functions
The following is a summary of Xv library functions:
.sp 1l
XvGetPortAttribute(3X) \- return current port attribute value
.sp 1l
XvGetStill(3X) \- capture a single frame of video from a drawable
.sp 1l
XvGetVideo(3X) \- capture video from a drawable
.sp 1l
XvGrabPort(3X) \- lock port for exclusive use by client
.sp 1l
XvPortNotify(3X) \- event generated when port attributes change
.sp 1l
XvPutStill(3X) \- write a single frame of video to a drawable
.sp 1l
XvPutVideo(3X) \- write video into a drawable
.sp 1l
XvQueryAdaptors(3X) \- return adaptor information for a screen
.sp 1l
XvQueryBestSize(3X) \- determine the optimum drawable region size
.sp 1l
XvQueryEncodings(3X) \- return list of encodings for an adaptor
.sp 1l
XvQueryExtension(3X) \- return version and revision of extension
.sp 1l
XvSelectPortNotify(3X) \- enable or disable XvPortNotify events
.sp 1l
XvSelectVideoNotify(3X) \- enable or disable XvVideoNotify events
.sp 1l
XvSetPortAttribute(3X) \- set an attribute for a port 
.sp 1l
XvStopVideo(3X) \- stop active video 
.sp 1l
XvUngrabPort(3X) \- release a grabbed port
.sp 1l
XvVideoNotify(3X) \- event generated for video processing
.sp 1l
.PP
Each of these functions is described in its own Xv man page.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

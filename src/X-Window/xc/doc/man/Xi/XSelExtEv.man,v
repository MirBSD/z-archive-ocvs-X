Specifies the connection to the X server.

.TP 12
.I w
Specifies the window \*(Wi.
.TP 12
.I event_list
Specifies the list of event classes that describe the events you are interested in.

.I event_count
Specifies the count of event classes in the event list.

.I this_client_event_list_return
Returns a pointer to the list of event classes selected by this client.
.TP 12
.I all_clients_event_count_return
Returns the count of event classes selected by all clients.
.TP 12
.I all_clients_event_list_return
Returns a pointer to the list of event classes selected by all clients.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIXSelectExtensionEvent\fP request causes the X server to report the 
events associated with the 
specified list of event classes.
Initially, X will not report any of these events.
Events are reported relative to a window.
If a window is not interested in a device event, it usually propagates to
the closest ancestor that is interested,
unless the do_not_propagate mask prohibits it.
.LP
Multiple clients can select for the same events on the same window
with the following restrictions:
.IP \(bu 5
Multiple clients can select events on the same window because their event masks
are disjoint.
When the X server generates an event, it reports it
to all interested clients.
.IP \(bu 5
Only one client at a time can select a 
\fIDeviceButtonPress\fP 
event with automatic passive grabbing enabled, which is associated with
the event class \fIDeviceButtonPressGrab\fP.
To receive \fIDeviceButtonPress\fP events without automatic passive
grabbing, use event class \fIDeviceButtonPress\fP but do not specify
event class \fIDeviceButtonPressGrab\fP.
.LP
The server reports the event to all interested clients.
.LP
Information contained in the \fIXDevice\fP structure returned by
\fIXOpenDevice\fP is used
by macros to obtain the event classes that clients use in making
\fIXSelectExtensionEvent\fP requests.  Currently defined macros include
\fIDeviceKeyPress\fP, \fIDeviceKeyRelease\fP, \fIDeviceButtonPress\fP, 
\fIDeviceButtonRelese\fP, \fIDeviceMotionNotify\fP, \fIDeviceFocusIn\fP, 
\fIDeviceFocusOut\fP, \fIProximityIn\fP, \fIProximityOut\fP, 
\fIDeviceStateNotify\fP, \fIDeviceMappiingNotify\fP, 
\fIChangeDeviceNotify\fP, \fIDevicePointerMotionHint\fP, 
\fIDeviceButton1Motion\fP, \fIDeviceButton2Motion\fP, \fIDeviceButton3Motion\fP,
\fIDeviceButton4Motion\fP, \fIDeviceButton5Motion\fP, \fIDeviceButtonMotion\fP,
\fIDeviceOwnerGrabButton\fP, \fIDeviceButtonPressGrab\fP, and
\fINoExtensionEvent\fP.
.LP
To obtain the proper event class for a particular device, one of the above
macros is invoked using the \fIXDevice\fP structure for that device.  For
example, 
.LP
.DS 0
.TA .5i
.ta .5i
DeviceKeyPress (*device, type, eventclass);
.DE
.LP
returns the \fIDeviceKeyPress\fP event type and the eventclass for selecting
\fIDeviceKeyPress\fP events from this device.
.LP
\fIXSelectExtensionEvent\fP
can generate a \fIBadWindow\fP or \fIBadClass\fP error.
The
\fIXGetSelectedExtensionEvents\fP
request reports the extension events selected by this client and all clients
for the specified window.  This request returns pointers to two 
\fIXEventClass\fP
arrays.  One lists the input extension events selected by this client from
the specified window.  The other lists the event classes selected by all
clients from the specified window.  You should use \fIXFree\fP to free these
two arrays.
.LP
\fIXGetSelectedExtensionEvents\fP
can generate a \fIBadWindow\fP error.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP 12
\fIBadWindow\fP
A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
.TP 12
\fIBadClass\fP
A value for an XEventClass argument is invalid.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

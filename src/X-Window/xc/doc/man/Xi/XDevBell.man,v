.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP 12
.I display
Specifies the connection to the X server.
.TP 12
.I device
Specifies the device with which the bell is associated.
.TP 12
.I feedbackclass
Specifies the class of the feedback with which the bell is associated.
.TP 12
.I feedbackid
Specifies the id of the feedback with which the bell is associated.
.TP 12
.I percent
Specifies the volume in the range -100 to 100 at which the bell should be rung.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIXDeviceBell\fP request causes the server to ring a bell on the 
specified feedback of the specified device, if possible.  
The specified volume is relative to the base volume for the bell.
If an invalid device is specified,
a \fIBadDevice\fP error will be returned.  The feedbackclass and feedbackid
parameters contain values returned by an \fIXGetFeedbackControl\fP request
and uniquely identify the bell to ring.  If a feedbackclass is specified that
does not support a bell, or if a nonexistent feedbackid is specified,
or a percent value is specified that is not in the range -100 to 100,
a \fIBadValue\fP error will be returned.
.LP
The volume at which the bell is rung when the percent argument is 
nonnegative is:
.IP
base \- [(base * percent) / 100] + percent
.LP
The volume at which the bell rings
when the percent argument is negative is:
.IP
base + [(base * percent) / 100]
.LP
To change the base volume of the bell, use \fIXChangeFeedbackControl\fP.
.LP
\fIXDeviceBell\fP can generate a \fIBadDevice\fP or a \fIBadValue\fP
error.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP 12
\fIBadDevice\fP
An invalid device was specified.  The specified device does not exist, or has 
not been opened by this client via \fIXOpenInputDevice\fP.
.TP 12
\fIBadValue\fP
An invalid feedbackclass, feedbackid, or percent value was specified.

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@That's what OpenBSD will, probably, ship as XF4 in 3.5
their last sync against XFree86 4.3-current has been
imported into our vendor branch, too

.ds xL Programming with Xlib
.TH XQueryDeviceState 3X11 __xorgversion__ "X FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
XQueryDeviceState \- query the state of an extension input device.
.SH SYNTAX
XQueryDeviceState\^(\^\fIdisplay\fP, \fIdevice\fP\^)
.br
      Display *\fIdisplay\fP\^;
.br
      XDevice *\fIdevice\fP\^; 
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP 12
.I display
Specifies the connection to the X server.
.TP 12
.I device
Specifies the device whose state is to be queried.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIXQueryDeviceState\fP
request queries the state of an input device.  The current state of 
keys and buttons (up or down), and valuators (current value) on the device 
is reported by this request.  Each key or button is represented by a bit
in the \fIXDeviceState\fP structure that is returned.  Valuators on the 
device report 0 if they are reporting relative information, and the
current value if they are reporting absolute information.
.LP
\fIXQueryDeviceState\fP
can generate a \fIBadDevice\fP error.
.SH STRUCTURES
The
\fIXDeviceState\fP
structure contains:
.LP
.nf
typedef struct {
	XID device_id;
	int num_classes;
	XInputClass *data;
} XDeviceState;
.fi
.LP
The
\fIXValuatorState\fP
structure contains:
.LP
.nf
typedef struct {
	unsigned char class;
	unsigned char length;
	unsigned char num_valuators;
	unsigned char mode;
	int *valuators;
} XValuatorState;
.fi
.LP
The \fIXKeyState\fP structure contains:
.LP
.nf
typedef struct {
	unsigned char class;
	unsigned char length;
	short         num_keys;
	char keys[32];
} XKeyState;
.fi
.LP
The \fIXButtonState\fP structure contains:
.LP
.nf
typedef struct {
	unsigned char class;
	unsigned char length;
	short         num_buttons;
	char buttons[32];
} XButtonState;
.fi
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP 12
\fIBadDevice\fP
An invalid device was specified.  The specified device does not exist or has 
not been opened by this client via \fIXOpenInputDevice\fP.  This error may
also occur if some other client has caused the specified device to become
the X keyboard or X pointer device via the \fIXChangeKeyboardDevice\fP or
\fIXChangePointerDevice\fP requests.

log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@That's what OpenBSD will, probably, ship as XF4 in 3.5
their last sync against XFree86 4.3-current has been
imported into our vendor branch, too

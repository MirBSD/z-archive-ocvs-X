.TP 12
.I display
Specifies the connection to the X server.
.TP 12
.I device
Specifies the device from which the events are to be sent.
.TP 12
.I destination
Specifies the window the event is to be sent to.  You can pass window id,
\fIPointerWindow\fP,
or
\fIInputFocus\fP.
.TP 12
.I propagate
Specifies a Boolean value that is either True or False. 
.TP 12
.I event_count
Specifies the count of XEventClasses in event_list.

Specifies the list of event selections to be used.
.TP 12
.I event_send
Specifies a pointer to the event that is to be sent.
.TP 12
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIXSendExtensionEvent\fP
request identifies the destination window, 
determines which clients should receive the specified events, 
and ignores any active grabs.
This request requires you to pass an event class list.
For a discussion of the valid event class names,
see \fIXOpenDevice(3X11)\fP.
This request uses the w argument to identify the destination window as follows:
.IP \(bu 5
If w is
\fIPointerWindow\fP ,
the destination window is the window that contains the pointer.
.IP \(bu 5
If w is
\fIInputFocus\fP 
and if the focus window contains the pointer, 
the destination window is the window that contains the pointer; 
otherwise, the destination window is the focus window.
.LP
To determine which clients should receive the specified events,
\fIXSendExtensionEvent\fP
uses the propagate argument as follows:
.IP \(bu 5
If event_list is the empty set,
the event is sent to the client that created the destination window.
If that client no longer exists,
no event is sent.
.IP \(bu 5
If propagate is 
\fIFalse\fP,
the event is sent to every client selecting on destination any of the event
types specified by the event_list array.
.IP \(bu 5
If propagate is 
\fITrue\fP 
and no clients have selected on destination any of
the events specified by the event_list array, 
the destination is replaced with the
closest ancestor of destination for which some client has selected a
type specified by the event-list array and for which no intervening 
window has that type in its
do-not-propagate-mask. 
If no such window exists or if the window is
an ancestor of the focus window and 
\fIInputFocus\fP 
was originally specified
as the destination, the event is not sent to any clients.
Otherwise, the event is reported to every client selecting on the final
destination any of the events specified in the event_list array.
.LP
The event in the
\fIXEvent\fP
structure must be one of the events defined by the input extension (or a 
\fIBadValue\fP
error results) so that the X server can correctly byte-swap 
the contents as necessary.  
The contents of the event are
otherwise unaltered and unchecked by the X server except to force send_event to
\fITrue\fP
in the forwarded event and to set the serial number in the event correctly.
.LP
\fIXSendExtensionEvent\fP
returns zero if the conversion to wire protocol format failed
and returns nonzero otherwise.
\fIXSendExtensionEvent\fP
can generate
\fIBadClass\fP,
\fIBadDevice\fP,
\fIBadValue\fP,
and
\fIBadWindow\fP 
errors.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP 12
\fIBadDevice\fP
An invalid device was specified.  The specified device does not exist or has 
not been opened by this client via \fIXOpenInputDevice\fP.  This error may
also occur if the specified device is the X keyboard or X pointer device.
.TP 12
\fIBadValue\fP
Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted by the request.
Unless a specific range is specified for an argument, the full range defined
by the argument's type is accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of
alternatives can generate this error.
.TP 12
\fIBadWindow\fP
A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@That's what OpenBSD will, probably, ship as XF4 in 3.5
their last sync against XFree86 4.3-current has been
imported into our vendor branch, too

.I display
Specifies the connection to the X server.

.I device
Specifies the device whose mode is to be changed.
.TP 12
.I mode
Specifies the mode.
You can pass 
\fIAbsolute\fP ,
or
\fIRelative\fP.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIXSetDeviceMode\fP
request changes the mode of an input device that is capable of reporting
either absolute positional information or relative motion information.  
Not all input devices are capable of reporting motion data, and not
all are capable of changing modes from \fIAbsolute\fP to \fIRelative\fP.
.LP
\fIXSetDeviceMode\fP
can generate a \fIBadDevice\fP or
\fIBadMode\fP 
error.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP 12
\fIBadDevice\fP
An invalid device was specified.  The specified device does not exist or has 
not been opened by this client via \fIXOpenInputDevice\fP.  This error may
also occur if some other client has caused the specified device to become
the X keyboard or X pointer device via the \fIXChangeKeyboardDevice\fP or
\fIXChangePointerDevice\fP requests.
.TP 12
\fIBadMatch\fP
This error may occur if an \fIXSetDeviceMode\fP request is made 
specifying a device that has no valuators and reports no axes of motion.
.TP 12
\fIBadMode\fP
An invalid mode was specified.  This error will also be returned if the
specified device is not capable of supporting the \fIXSetDeviceMode\fP
request.

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

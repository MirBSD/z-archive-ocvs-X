.SH ARGUMENTS
.ds Bu grabbed or released
.TP 12
.I display
Specifies the connection to the X server.
.TP 12

.TP 12
.I Key
Specifies the device Key that is to be \*(Bu or
\fIAnyKey\fP.
.TP 12
.I modifiers
Specifies the set of keymasks or
\fIAnyModifier\fP.
The mask is the bitwise inclusive OR of the valid keymask bits.
Valid bits are: ShiftMask, LockMask, ControlMask, Mod1Mask, Mod2Mask,
Mod3Mask, Mod4Mask, Mod5Mask.
.TP 12
.I modifier_device
Specifies the device whose modifiers are to be used.  If a modifier_device of
NULL is specified, the X keyboard will be used as the modifier_device.
.TP 12
.I grab_window
Specifies the grab window.
.TP 12
.I owner_events
Specifies a Boolean value that indicates whether the device 
events are to be reported as usual or reported with respect to the grab window 
if selected by the event list.
.TP 12
.I event_count
Specifies the number of event classes in the event list.
.TP 12
.I event_list
Specifies which device events are reported to the client.
.TP 12
.I this_device_mode
Specifies further processing of events from this device.
You can pass \fIGrabModeSync\fP or \fIGrabModeAsync\fP.
.TP 12
.I other_devices_mode
Specifies further processing of events from other devices.
You can pass 
\fIGrabModeSync\fP 
or
\fIGrabModeAsync\fP.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIXGrabDeviceKey\fP request establishes a passive grab.
In the future,
the device is actively grabbed (as for
\fIXGrabDevice\fP,
the last-device-grab time is set to the time at which the Key was pressed
(as transmitted in the
\fIDeviceKeyPress\fP
event), and the
\fIDeviceKeyPress\fP
event is reported if all of the following conditions are true:
.IP \(bu 5
The device is not grabbed, and the specified key is logically pressed
when the specified modifier keys are logically down,
and no other keys or modifier keys are logically down.
.IP \(bu 5
The grab_window is an ancestor (or is) the focus window OR the grab
window is a descendant of the focus window and contains the device.
.IP \(bu 5
The confine_to window (if any) is viewable.
.IP \(bu 5
A passive grab on the same key/modifier combination does not exist
on any ancestor of grab_window.
.LP
The interpretation of the remaining arguments is as for
\fIXGrabDevice\fP .
The active grab is terminated automatically when the logical state of the
device has the specified key released.
.LP
Note that the logical state of a device (as seen by means of the X protocol )
may lag the physical state if device event processing is frozen.
.LP
If the key is not \fIAnyKey\fP, it must be in the range specified by
min_keycode and max_keycode as returned by the \fIXListInputDevices\fP
request.  Otherwise, a \fIBadValue\fP error results.
.LP
This request overrides all previous grabs by the same client on the same
Key/modifier combinations on the same window.
A modifier of 
\fIAnyModifier\fP 
is equivalent to issuing the grab request for all
possible modifier combinations (including the combination of no modifiers).  
It is not required that all modifiers specified have currently assigned 
KeyCodes.
A key of 
\fIAnyKey\fP 
is equivalent to
issuing the request for all possible keys.
Otherwise, it is not required that the specified key currently be assigned
to a physical Key.
.LP
If a modifier_device of NULL is specified, the X keyboard will be used as
the modifier_device.
.LP
If some other client has already issued a 
\fIXGrabDeviceKey\fP
with the same Key/modifier combination on the same window, a
\fIBadAccess\fP 
error results.
When using 
\fIAnyModifier\fP 
or 
\fIAnyKey\fP , 
the request fails completely,
and a
\fIBadAccess\fP
error results (no grabs are
established) if there is a conflicting grab for any combination.
\fIXGrabDeviceKey\fP
has no effect on an active grab.
.LP
\fIXGrabDeviceKey\fP
can generate
\fIBadAccess\fP,
\fIBadClass\fP,
\fIBadDevice\fP,
\fIBadMatch\fP,
\fIBadValue\fP,
and
\fIBadWindow\fP 
errors.  It returns \fISuccess\fP on successful completion of the request.
.P 
The \fIXUngrabDeviceKey\fP
request releases the passive grab for a key/modifier combination on the 
specified window if it was grabbed by this client.
A modifier of \fIAnyModifier\fP is
equivalent to issuing 
the ungrab request for all possible modifier combinations, including 
the combination of no modifiers.
A Key of \fIAnyKey\fP 
is equivalent to issuing the request for all possible Keys.
\fIXUngrabDeviceKey\fP has no effect on an active grab.
.LP
If a modifier_device of NULL is specified, the X keyboard will be used as the
modifier_device.
.LP
\fIXUngrabDeviceKey\fP can generate \fIBadDevice\fP, \fIBadMatch\fP,
\fIBadValue\fP and \fIBadWindow\fP errors.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP 12
\fIBadDevice\fP
An invalid device was specified.  The specified device does not exist or has 
not been opened by this client via \fIXOpenInputDevice\fP.  This error may
also occur if the specified device is the X keyboard or X pointer device.
.TP 12
\fIBadMatch\fP
This error may occur if an \fIXGrabDeviceKey\fP request was made
specifying a device that has no keys, or a modifier device that has no
keys.
.TP 12
\fIBadValue\fP
Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted by the request.
Unless a specific range is specified for an argument, the full range defined
by the argument's type is accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of
alternatives can generate this error.
.TP 12
\fIBadWindow\fP
A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

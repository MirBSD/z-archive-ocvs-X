.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP 12
.I display
Specifies the connection to the X server.
.TP 12
.I device
Specifies the device to be used as the X pointer.
.TP 12
.I xaxis
Specifies the axis of the device to be used as the X pointer x-axis.
.TP 12
.I yaxis
Specifies the axis of the device to be used as the X pointer y-axis.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIXChangePointerDevice\fP request causes the server to use the specified
device as the X pointer.  The device must have been opened by the client via
\fIXOpenDevice\fP or a \fIBadDevice\fP error will result.  The device must
support input class \fIValuators\fP or a \fIBadMatch\fP error will result.
If the implementation does not support use of the specified device as the
X pointer, a \fIBadDevice\fP error will result.
.LP
If the specified device is grabbed by another client, \fIAlreadyGrabbed\fP
is returned.  If the specified device is frozen by a grab on another device,
\fIGrabFrozen\fP is returned.
If the request is successful, \fISuccess\fP is returned.
.LP
If the request succeeds,
a \fIChangeDeviceNotify\fP event is sent to all clients that have selected that
event.  A \fIMappingNotify\fP event with request = \fIMappingPointer\fP is
sent to all clients.
The specified device becomes the X pointer, and
the old X pointer becomes accessible through the input extension
protocol requests.
.LP
\fIXChangePointerDevice\fP can generate a \fIBadDevice\fP or a \fIBadMatch\fP
error.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP 12
\fIBadDevice\fP
An invalid device was specified.  The specified device does not exist, has 
not been opened by this client via \fIXOpenInputDevice\fP, or is already
one of the core X input devices (pointer or keyboard).  This error may also
occur if the server implementation does not support using the specified
device as the X pointer.
.TP 12
\fIBadMatch\fP
This error may occur if an \fIXChangePointerDevice\fP request was made 
specifying a device that has less than two valuators, or specifying a 
valuator index beyond the range supported by the device.

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@That's what OpenBSD will, probably, ship as XF4 in 3.5
their last sync against XFree86 4.3-current has been
imported into our vendor branch, too

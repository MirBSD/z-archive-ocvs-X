.TH XtSetKeyboardFocus 3Xt __xorgversion__ "XT FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
XtSetKeyboardFocus \- focus events on a child widget
.SH SYNTAX
XtSetKeyboardFocus(\fIsubtree\fP\, \fIdescendant\fP)
.br
     Widget \fIsubtree\fP, \fIdescendant\fP;
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP \fIdescendant\fP 1i
Specifies either the widget in the subtree structure which is to receive the 
keyboard event, or 
.ZN None .
Note that it is not an error to specify
.ZN None
when no input focus was previously set.
.ds Wi for which the keyboard focus is to be set
.IP \fIw\fP 1i
Specifies the widget \*(Wi.
.SH DESCRIPTION
If a future 
.ZN KeyPress
or
.ZN KeyRelease 
event occurs within the specified subtree,
.ZN XtSetKeyboardFocus
causes
.ZN XtDispatchEvent
to remap and send the event to the specified descendant widget.
.LP
When there is no modal cascade,
keyboard events can occur within a widget W in one of three ways:
.IP \(bu 5
W has the X input focus.
.IP \(bu 5
W has the keyboard focus of one of its ancestors,
and the event occurs within the ancestor or one of the ancestor's descendants.
.IP \(bu 5
No ancestor of W has a descendant within the keyboard focus,
and the pointer is within W.
.LP
When there is a modal cascade,
a widget W receives keyboard events if an ancestor of W is in the active
subset of the modal cascade and one or more of the previous conditions is
.ZN True .
.LP
When subtree or one of its descendants acquires the X input focus
or the pointer moves into the subtree such that keyboard events would
now be delivered to subtree, a
.ZN FocusIn
event is generated for the descendant if
.ZN FocusNotify
events have been selected by the descendant.
Similarly, when W loses the X input focus
or the keyboard focus for one of its ancestors, a
.ZN FocusOut
event is generated for descendant if
.ZN FocusNotify
events have been selected by the descendant.

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

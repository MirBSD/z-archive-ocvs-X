.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.ZN XtManageChildren
function performs the following:
.IP \(bu 5
Issues an error if the children do not all have the same parent or
if the parent is not a subclass of 
.ZN compositeWidgetClass .
.IP \(bu 5
Returns immediately if the common parent is being destroyed;
otherwise, for each unique child on the list,
.ZN XtManageChildren
ignores the child if it already is managed or is being destroyed
and marks it if not.
.IP \(bu 5
If the parent is realized and after all children have been marked,
it makes some of the newly managed children viewable:
.RS
.IP \- 5
Calls the change_managed routine of the widgets' parent.
.IP \- 5
Calls
.ZN XtRealizeWidget
on each previously unmanaged child that is unrealized.
.IP \- 5
Maps each previously unmanaged child that has map_when_managed 
.ZN True .
.RE
.LP
Managing children is independent of the ordering of children and
independent of creating and deleting children.
The layout routine of the parent
should consider children whose managed field is
.ZN True 
and should ignore all other children.
Note that some composite widgets, especially fixed boxes, call
.ZN XtManageChild
from their insert_child procedure.
.LP
If the parent widget is realized,
its change_managed procedure is called to notify it
that its set of managed children has changed.
The parent can reposition and resize any of its children.
It moves each child as needed by calling 
.ZN XtMoveWidget ,
which first updates the x and y fields and then calls
.ZN XMoveWindow
if the widget is realized.
.LP
The
.ZN XtManageChild
function constructs a
.ZN WidgetList
of length one and calls
.ZN XtManageChildren .
.LP
The
.ZN XtUnmanageChildren
function performs the following:
.IP \(bu 5
Issues an error if the children do not all have the same parent
or if the parent is not a subclass of 
.ZN compositeWidgetClass .
.IP \(bu 5
Returns immediately if the common parent is being destroyed;
otherwise, for each unique child on the list, 
.ZN XtUnmanageChildren
performs the following:
.RS
.IP \- 5
Ignores the child if it already is unmanaged or is being destroyed
and marks it if not.
.IP \- 5
If the child is realized,
it makes it nonvisible by unmapping it.
.RE
.IP \(bu 5
Calls the change_managed routine of the widgets' parent
after all children have been marked
if the parent is realized.
.LP
.ZN XtUnmanageChildren
does not destroy the children widgets.
Removing widgets from a parent's managed set is often a temporary banishment,
and, some time later, you may manage the children again.
.LP
The
.ZN XtUnmanageChild
function constructs a widget list
of length one and calls
.ZN XtUnmanageChildren .
.LP
The
.ZN XtChangeManagedSet
function performs the following:
.IP \(bu 5
Issues an error if the widgets specified in the \fImanage_children\fP
and the \fIunmanage_children\fP lists to no all have the same parent, or
if that parent is not a subclass of compositeWidgetClass.
.IP \(bu 5
Returns immediately if the common parent is being destroyed.
.IP \(bu 5
If no
.ZN CompositeClassExtension
is defined, or a
.ZN CompositeClassExtension
is defined but with an \fIallows_change_managed_set\fP field with a
value of
.ZN False ,
and
.ZN XtChangeManagedSet 
was invoked with a non-NULL \fIpost_unmanage_pre_manage_hook\fP procedure 
then
.ZN XtChangeManagedSet
performs the following:
.RS
.IP \- 5
Calls
.ZN XtUnmanageChildren
(\fIunmanage_children\fP, \fInum_unmanage_children\fP).
.IP \- 5
Calls the \fIpost_unmanage_pre_manage_hook\fP specified.
.IP \- 5
Calls
.ZN XtManageChildren
(\fImanage_children\fP, \fInum_manage_children\fP) and then returns
immediately.
.RE
.IP \(bu 5
Otherwise, if a
.ZN CompositeClassExtension
is defined with an \fIallows_change_managed_set\fP field with a value of
.ZN True ,
or if no
.ZN CompositeClassExtension
is defined, and
.ZN XtChangeManagedSet was invoked with a NULL 
\fIpost_unmanage_pre_manage_hook\fP procedure, then the following is
performed:
.RS
.IP \- 5
For each child on the \fIunmanage_children\fP list; if the child is
already unmanaged or is being destroyed it is ignored, otherwise it
is marked as being unmanaged and if it is realized it is made nonvisible
by being unmapped.
.IP \- 5
If the \fIpost_unmanage_pre_manage_hook\fP procdedure is non-NULL then
it is invoked as specified.
.IP \- 5
For each child on the \fImanage_children\fP list; if the child is
already managed or it is being destroyed it is ignored, otherwise it
is marked as managed
.RE
.IP \(bu 5
If the parent is realized and after all children have been marked, the
change_managed method of the parent is invoked and subsequently some
of the newly managed children are made viewable by:
.RS
.IP \- 5
Calling
.ZN XtRealizeWidget
on each of the previously unmanaged child that is unrealized.
.IP \- 5
Mapping each previously unmanaged child that has \fImap_when_managed\fP
.ZN True .
.RE
.LP
The
.ZN XtIsManaged
function returns
.ZN True
if the specified widget is of class RectObj or any subclass thereof and
is managed, or
.ZN False
otherwise.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

      unsigned char \fImap_return\fP\^[]\^;
.br
      int \fInmap\fP\^;
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP \fIdisplay\fP 1i
Specifies the connection to the X server.
.IP \fImap\fP 1i
Specifies the mapping list.
.IP \fImap_return\fP 1i
Returns the mapping list.
.IP \fInmap\fP 1i
Specifies the number of items in the mapping list.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.ZN XSetPointerMapping
function sets the mapping of the pointer.
If it succeeds, the X server generates a
.ZN MappingNotify
event, and
.ZN XSetPointerMapping
returns
.ZN MappingSuccess .
Element map[i] defines the logical button number for the physical button
i+1.
The length of the list must be the same as
.ZN XGetPointerMapping
would return,
or a
.ZN BadValue
error results.
A zero element disables a button, and elements are not restricted in
value by the number of physical buttons.
However, no two elements can have the same nonzero value,
or a
.ZN BadValue
error results.
If any of the buttons to be altered are logically in the down state,
.ZN XSetPointerMapping
returns
.ZN MappingBusy ,
and the mapping is not changed.
.LP
.ZN XSetPointerMapping
can generate a
.ZN BadValue 
error.
.LP
The
.ZN XGetPointerMapping
function returns the current mapping of the pointer.
Pointer buttons are numbered starting from one.
.ZN XGetPointerMapping
returns the number of physical buttons actually on the pointer.
The nominal mapping for a pointer is map[i]=i+1.
The nmap argument specifies the length of the array where the pointer
mapping is returned, and only the first nmap elements are returned 
in map_return.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP 1i
.ZN BadValue
Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted by the request.
Unless a specific range is specified for an argument, the full range defined
by the argument's type is accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of
alternatives can generate this error.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@That's what OpenBSD will, probably, ship as XF4 in 3.5
their last sync against XFree86 4.3-current has been
imported into our vendor branch, too

.TH XConfigureEvent 3X11 __xorgversion__ "XLIB FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
XConfigureEvent \- ConfigureNotify event structure
.SH STRUCTURES
The structure for
.ZN ConfigureNotify
events contains:
.LP
.Ds 0
.TA .5i 3i
.ta .5i 3i
typedef struct {
	int type;	/* ConfigureNotify */
	unsigned long serial;	/* # of last request processed by server */
	Bool send_event;	/* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
	Display *display;	/* Display the event was read from */
	Window event;
	Window window;
	int x, y;
	int width, height;
	int border_width;
	Window above;
	Bool override_redirect;
} XConfigureEvent;
.De
.LP
When you receive this event,
the structure members are set as follows.
.LP
The type member is set to the event type constant name that uniquely identifies
it.
For example, when the X server reports a
.ZN GraphicsExpose
event to a client application, it sends an
.ZN XGraphicsExposeEvent
structure with the type member set to
.ZN GraphicsExpose .
The display member is set to a pointer to the display the event was read on.
The send_event member is set to
.ZN True
if the event came from a
.ZN SendEvent
protocol request.
The serial member is set from the serial number reported in the protocol
but expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value.
The window member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit
dispatchers.
.LP
The event member is set either to the reconfigured window or to its parent,
depending on whether
.ZN StructureNotify
or
.ZN SubstructureNotify
was selected.
The window member is set to the window whose size, position, 
border, and/or stacking
order was changed.
.LP
The x and y members are set to the coordinates relative to the parent window's 
origin and indicate the position of the upper-left outside corner of the window.
The width and height members are set to the inside size of the window, 
not including
the border.
The border_width member is set to the width of the window's border, in pixels.
.LP
The above member is set to the sibling window and is used 
for stacking operations.
If the X server sets this member to
.ZN None ,
the window whose state was changed is on the bottom of the stack
with respect to sibling windows.
However, if this member is set to a sibling window, 
the window whose state was changed is placed on top of this sibling window.
.LP
The override_redirect member is set to the override-redirect attribute of the
window.
Window manager clients normally should ignore this window if the 
override_redirect member
is
.ZN True .

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@That's what OpenBSD will, probably, ship as XF4 in 3.5
their last sync against XFree86 4.3-current has been
imported into our vendor branch, too

.LP
int XPending\^(\^\fIdisplay\fP\^)
.br
      Display *\fIdisplay\fP\^;
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP \fIdiscard\fP 1i
Specifies a Boolean value that indicates whether 
.ZN XSync
discards all events on the event queue.
.IP \fIdisplay\fP 1i
Specifies the connection to the X server.
.IP \fImode\fP 1i
Specifies the mode.
You can pass
.ZN QueuedAlready ,
.ZN QueuedAfterFlush ,
or
.ZN QueuedAfterReading .
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.ZN XFlush
function
flushes the output buffer.
Most client applications need not use this function because the output
buffer is automatically flushed as needed by calls to
.ZN XPending ,
.ZN XNextEvent ,
and
.ZN XWindowEvent .
.IN "XPending"
.IN "XNextEvent"
.IN "XWindowEvent"
Events generated by the server may be enqueued into the library's event queue.
.LP
The
.ZN XSync
function
flushes the output buffer and then waits until all requests have been received
and processed by the X server.
Any errors generated must be handled by the error handler.
For each protocol error received by Xlib,
.ZN XSync
calls the client application's error handling routine (see section 11.8.2).
Any events generated by the server are enqueued into the library's 
event queue.
.LP
Finally, if you passed 
.ZN False ,
.ZN XSync
does not discard the events in the queue.
If you passed 
.ZN True ,
.ZN XSync 
discards all events in the queue,
including those events that were on the queue before
.ZN XSync
was called.
Client applications seldom need to call
.ZN XSync .
.LP
If mode is 
.ZN QueuedAlready ,
.ZN XEventsQueued 
returns the number of events
already in the event queue (and never performs a system call).
If mode is 
.ZN QueuedAfterFlush , 
.ZN XEventsQueued
returns the number of events already in the queue if the number is nonzero.
If there are no events in the queue, 
.ZN XEventsQueued
flushes the output buffer, 
attempts to read more events out of the application's connection,
and returns the number read.
If mode is 
.ZN QueuedAfterReading , 
.ZN XEventsQueued
returns the number of events already in the queue if the number is nonzero. 
If there are no events in the queue, 
.ZN XEventsQueued
attempts to read more events out of the application's connection 
without flushing the output buffer and returns the number read.
.LP
.ZN XEventsQueued
always returns immediately without I/O if there are events already in the
queue.
.ZN XEventsQueued
with mode 
.ZN QueuedAfterFlush
is identical in behavior to
.ZN XPending .
.ZN XEventsQueued
with mode
.ZN QueuedAlready
is identical to the
.ZN XQLength
function.
.LP
The
.ZN XPending
function returns the number of events that have been received from the
X server but have not been removed from the event queue.
.ZN XPending
is identical to
.ZN XEventsQueued
with the mode
.ZN QueuedAfterFlush
specified.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@That's what OpenBSD will, probably, ship as XF4 in 3.5
their last sync against XFree86 4.3-current has been
imported into our vendor branch, too

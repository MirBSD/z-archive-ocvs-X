.SH NAME
XSelectInput \- select input events
.SH SYNTAX
XSelectInput\^(\^\fIdisplay\fP, \fIw\fP\^, \fIevent_mask\fP\^)
.br
      Display *\fIdisplay\fP\^;
.br
      Window \fIw\fP\^;
.br
      long \fIevent_mask\fP\^;
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP \fIdisplay\fP 1i
Specifies the connection to the X server.
.IP \fIevent_mask\fP 1i
Specifies the event mask.
.ds Wi whose events you are interested in
.IP \fIw\fP 1i
Specifies the window \*(Wi.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.ZN XSelectInput
function requests that the X server report the events associated with the 
specified event mask.
Initially, X will not report any of these events.
Events are reported relative to a window.
If a window is not interested in a device event, it usually propagates to
the closest ancestor that is interested,
unless the do_not_propagate mask prohibits it.
.IN "Event" "propagation"
.LP
Setting the event-mask attribute of a window overrides any previous call
for the same window but not for other clients.
Multiple clients can select for the same events on the same window
with the following restrictions:
.IP \(bu 5
Multiple clients can select events on the same window because their event masks
are disjoint.
When the X server generates an event, it reports it
to all interested clients.
.IP \(bu 5
Only one client at a time can select
.ZN CirculateRequest ,
.ZN ConfigureRequest ,
or
.ZN MapRequest
events, which are associated with
the event mask
.ZN SubstructureRedirectMask . 
.IP \(bu 5
Only one client at a time can select
a
.ZN ResizeRequest
event, which is associated with
the event mask
.ZN ResizeRedirectMask . 
.IP \(bu 5
Only one client at a time can select a 
.ZN ButtonPress 
event, which is associated with
the event mask
.ZN ButtonPressMask .
.LP
The server reports the event to all interested clients.
.LP
.ZN XSelectInput
can generate a
.ZN BadWindow 
error.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP 1i
.ZN BadWindow
A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@That's what OpenBSD will, probably, ship as XF4 in 3.5
their last sync against XFree86 4.3-current has been
imported into our vendor branch, too

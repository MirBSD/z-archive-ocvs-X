.SH NAME
X.Org, XProjectTeam \- X.Org Group information
.SH SYNOPSIS
Release 6.5 and 6.6 of X Version 11 was brought to you by The X.Org Group.
Release 6.4 of X Version 11 was brought to you by The X Project Team.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The Open Group's X Project Team was created as the successor 
to the X Consortium, Inc., after the X Consortium was merged into
The Open Group. 
The X.Org Group (hereinafter called "X.Org") was created as the successor 
to The X Project Team after the The Open Group ceased operating
The X Project Team.
The purpose of X.Org is to foster development, evolution, and 
maintenance of the X Window System.  X.Org operates under the corporate
umbrella of The Open Group.
.PP
The X Consortium was an independent, not-for-profit Delaware membership
corporation.  It was formed in 1993 as the successor to the MIT X 
Consortium.
.PP
The X Window System was created in the mid-1980s at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.  In 1988, MIT formed a member-funded consortium 
to provide the technical and administrative leadership necessary to 
support further development of the X Window System.  In 1992, MIT and 
the membership decided it was in their best interests to move the 
consortium out of MIT and create an independent, stand-alone organization.  
All rights to the X Window System were assigned by MIT to X Consortium, 
Inc. on January 1, 1994.  X Consortium, Inc. closed its doors on December 
31, 1996.  All rights to the X Window System have been assigned to The 
Open Group, for the benefit of the members of X.Org.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

#
# Anyone who obtained a copy of this work is hereby permitted to freely use,
# distribute, modify, merge, sublicence, give away or sell it as long as the
# authors are given due credit and the following notice is retained:

# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-
# butor be held liable for any damage, directly or indirectly, that origina-

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

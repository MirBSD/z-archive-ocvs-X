.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\f2x\fP\ \f2y\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2x\fP, \f2y\fP
Specify the center of a picking region in window coordinates.
.TP
\f2delX\fP, \f2delY\fP
Specify the width and height, respectively, of the picking region in window 
coordinates.
.TP
\f2viewport\fP
Specifies the current viewport (as from a \f3glGetIntegerv\fP call).
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3gluPickMatrix\fP creates a projection matrix that can be used to restrict drawing
to a small region of the viewport.
This is typically useful to
determine what objects are being drawn near the cursor.
Use \%\f3gluPickMatrix\fP to
restrict drawing to a small region around the cursor.
Then,
enter selection mode (with \f3glRenderMode\fP) and rerender the scene.
All primitives that would have been drawn near
the cursor are identified and stored in the selection buffer.
.P
The matrix created by \%\f3gluPickMatrix\fP is multiplied by the current matrix just
as if \f3glMultMatrix\fP is called with the generated matrix.
To effectively use the generated pick matrix for picking,
first call \f3glLoadIdentity\fP to load an identity matrix onto the
perspective matrix stack.
Then call \%\f3gluPickMatrix\fP,
and finally, call a command (such as \%\f3gluPerspective\fP)
to multiply the perspective matrix by the pick matrix.
.P
When using \%\f3gluPickMatrix\fP to pick NURBS, be careful to turn off the NURBS 
property
\%\f3GLU_AUTO_LOAD_MATRIX\fP.  If \%\f3GLU_AUTO_LOAD_MATRIX\fP is not
turned off, then any NURBS surface rendered is subdivided differently with
the pick matrix than the way it was subdivided without the pick matrix.
.bp
.SH EXAMPLE
When rendering a scene as follows:
.sp
.Ex
glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION);
glLoadIdentity();
gluPerspective(...);
glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW);
/* Draw the scene */
.Ee
.sp
a portion of the viewport can be selected as a pick region like this:
.sp
.Ex
glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION);
glLoadIdentity();
gluPickMatrix(x, y, width, height, viewport);
gluPerspective(...);
glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW);
/* Draw the scene */
.Ee

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\f2nurb\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2nurb\fP
Specifies the NURBS object (created with \%\f3gluNewNurbsRenderer\fP).
.SH DESCRIPTION
Use \%\f3gluBeginCurve\fP to mark the beginning of a NURBS 
curve definition.
After 
calling \%\f3gluBeginCurve\fP, make one or more calls to
\%\f3gluNurbsCurve\fP to define the attributes of the curve.
Exactly one of the calls to \%\f3gluNurbsCurve\fP must have
a curve type of \%\f3GL_MAP1_VERTEX_3\fP or \%\f3GL_MAP1_VERTEX_4\fP.
To mark the end of the NURBS curve definition, call \%\f3gluEndCurve\fP.
.P
GL evaluators are used to render the NURBS curve as a series of line
segments.
Evaluator state is preserved during rendering
with \f3glPushAttrib\fP(\%\f3GL_EVAL_BIT\fP) and 
\f3glPopAttrib\fP().  
See the \f3glPushAttrib\fP reference page for details on exactly what state
these calls preserve.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following commands render a textured NURBS curve with normals;
texture coordinates and normals are also specified as NURBS curves:
.sp
.Ex
gluBeginCurve(nobj);
   gluNurbsCurve(nobj, ..., GL_MAP1_TEXTURE_COORD_2);
   gluNurbsCurve(nobj, ..., GL_MAP1_NORMAL);
   gluNurbsCurve(nobj, ..., GL_MAP1_VERTEX_4);
gluEndCurve(nobj);

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

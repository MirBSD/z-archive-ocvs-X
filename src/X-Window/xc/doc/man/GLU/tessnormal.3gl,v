\f2tess\fP
Specifies the tessellation object (created with \%\f3gluNewTess\fP).
.TP
\f2valueX\fP
Specifies the first component of the normal.
.TP
\f2valueY\fP
Specifies the second component of the normal.
.TP
\f2valueZ\fP
Specifies the third component of the normal.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3gluTessNormal\fP describes a normal for a polygon that the program is defining.
All input data will be projected onto a plane perpendicular to one of 
the three coordinate axes before tessellation and all output triangles
will be oriented CCW with 
respect to the normal (CW orientation can be obtained by reversing the
sign of the supplied normal). For example, if you know that all polygons
lie in the x-y plane, call \%\f3gluTessNormal\fP(tess, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0)
before rendering any polygons.
.P
If the supplied normal is (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) (the initial value), the normal is
determined as follows. The direction of the normal, up to its sign, is
found by fitting a plane to the vertices, without regard to how the
vertices are connected. It is expected that the input data lies approximately
in the plane; otherwise, projection perpendicular to one of the three
coordinate axes may substantially change the geometry. The sign of the
normal is chosen so that the sum of the signed areas of all input
contours is nonnegative (where a CCW contour has positive area).
.P
The supplied normal persists until it is changed by another call to 
\%\f3gluTessNormal\fP.

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

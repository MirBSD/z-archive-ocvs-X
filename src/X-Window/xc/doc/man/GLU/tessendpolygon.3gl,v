.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\f2tess\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2tess\fP
Specifies the tessellation object (created with \%\f3gluNewTess\fP).
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3gluTessBeginPolygon\fP and \%\f3gluTessEndPolygon\fP delimit the definition of a
convex, concave or self-intersecting polygon. Within each \%\f3gluTessBeginPolygon\fP/\%\f3gluTessEndPolygon\fP
pair, there must be one or more calls to \%\f3gluTessBeginContour\fP/\%\f3gluTessEndContour\fP. 
Within each contour, there are zero or more calls to \%\f3gluTessVertex\fP. The vertices 
specify a closed contour (the last vertex of each contour is automatically linked 
to the first). See the \%\f3gluTessVertex\fP, \%\f3gluTessBeginContour\fP and 
\%\f3gluTessEndContour\fP reference pages for more details.
.P
Once \%\f3gluTessEndPolygon\fP is called, the polygon is tessellated, and the
resulting triangles are described through callbacks.
See \%\f3gluTessCallback\fP for descriptions of the callback functions.
.SH EXAMPLE
A quadrilateral with a triangular hole in it can be described like this:
.sp
.Ex
gluTessBeginPolygon(tobj, NULL);
 gluTessBeginContour(tobj);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v1, v1);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v2, v2);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v3, v3);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v4, v4);
 gluTessEndContour(tobj);
 gluTessBeginContour(tobj);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v5, v5);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v6, v6);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v7, v7);
 gluTessEndContour(tobj);
gluTessEndPolygon(tobj);
.Ee
.bp
In the above example the pointers, $v1$ through $v7$, 
should point to different
addresses, 
since the values stored at these addresses will not be read by
the tesselator until \%\f3gluTessEndPolygon\fP is called.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

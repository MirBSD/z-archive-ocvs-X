.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\fIheight\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2quad\fP
Specifies the quadrics object (created with \%\f3gluNewQuadric\fP).
.TP
\f2base\fP
Specifies the radius of the cylinder at \f2z\fP = 0.
.TP
\f2top\fP
Specifies the radius of the cylinder at \f2z\fP = \f2height\fP.
.TP
\f2height\fP
Specifies the height of the cylinder.
.TP
\f2slices\fP
Specifies the number of subdivisions around the \f2z\fP axis.
.TP
\f2stacks\fP
Specifies the number of subdivisions along the \f2z\fP axis.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3gluCylinder\fP draws a cylinder oriented along the \f2z\fP axis. The base of the cylinder
is placed at \f2z\fP = 0, and the top at $ z ~=~ "height" $. Like a sphere,
a cylinder is subdivided around the \f2z\fP axis into slices, and along the 
\f2z\fP axis into stacks.
.P
Note that if \f2top\fP is set to 0.0, this routine generates a cone.
.P
If the orientation is set to \%\f3GLU_OUTSIDE\fP 
(with \%\f3gluQuadricOrientation\fP), then any generated normals
point away from the \f2z\fP axis. Otherwise, they point toward the 
\f2z\fP axis.
.P
If texturing is turned on (with \%\f3gluQuadricTexture\fP), then texture 
coordinates are generated so that \f2t\fP ranges linearly from 0.0 
at \f2z\fP = 0 to 1.0 at \f2z\fP = \f2height\fP, and \f2s\fP 
ranges from 0.0 at the +\f2y\fP axis, to 0.25 at the +\f2x\fP axis, 
to 0.5 at the -\f2y\fP axis, to 0.75 at the \-\f2x\fP axis, 
and back to 1.0 at the +\f2y\fP axis.

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

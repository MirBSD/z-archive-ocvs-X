.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\fIstride\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2nurb\fP
Specifies the NURBS object (created with \%\f3gluNewNurbsRenderer\fP).
.TP
\f2count\fP
Specifies the number of points on the curve.
.TP
\f2data\fP
Specifies an array containing the curve points.
.TP
\f2stride\fP
Specifies the offset (a number of single-precision floating-point values)
between points on the curve.
.TP
\f2type\fP
Specifies the type of curve.
Must be either \%\f3GLU_MAP1_TRIM_2\fP or \%\f3GLU_MAP1_TRIM_3\fP.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3gluPwlCurve\fP describes a piecewise linear trimming curve for a NURBS surface.
A piecewise linear curve consists of a list of 
coordinates of points in the parameter space for the
NURBS surface to be trimmed. These points are connected
with line segments to form a curve. If the curve is
an approximation to a curve that is not piecewise linear, 
the points should be close enough in parameter space that the 
resulting path appears curved at the resolution used in the application.
.P
If \f2type\fP is
\%\f3GLU_MAP1_TRIM_2\fP, then it describes a curve in two-dimensional (\f2u\fP 
and \f2v\fP) parameter space. If it is \%\f3GLU_MAP1_TRIM_3\fP, then it
describes a curve in two-dimensional homogeneous (\f2u\fP, \f2v\fP,
and \f2w\fP) parameter space. 
See the \%\f3gluBeginTrim\fP reference page for more information 
about trimming curves. 
.SH NOTES
To describe a trim curve that closely follows the contours of a NURBS 
surface, call \%\f3gluNurbsCurve\fP.

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

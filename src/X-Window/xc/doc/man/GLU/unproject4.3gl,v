.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\f2winX\fP\ \f2winY\fP\ \f2winZ\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2winX\fP, \f2winY\fP, \f2winZ\fP
Specify the window coordinates to be mapped.

Specify the clip w coordinate to be mapped.
.TP
\f2model\fP
Specifies the modelview matrix (as from a \f3glGetDoublev\fP call).
.TP
\f2proj\fP
Specifies the projection matrix (as from a \f3glGetDoublev\fP call).
.TP
\f2view\fP
Specifies the viewport (as from a \f3glGetIntegerv\fP call).
.TP
\f2near\fP, \f2far\fP
Specifies the near and far planes (as from a \f3glGetDoublev\fP call).
.TP
\f2objX\fP, \f2objY\fP, \f2objZ\fP, \f2objW\fP
Returns the computed object coordinates.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3gluUnProject4\fP maps the specified window coordinates \f2winX\fP, \f2winY\fP and \f2winZ\fP
and its clip w coordinate \f2clipW\fP
into object 
coordinates (\f2objX\fP, \f2objY\fP, \f2objZ\fP, \f2objW\fP)
using \f2model\fP, \f2proj\fP and \f2view\fP. \f2clipW\fP can be other than
1 as for vertices in \f3glFeedbackBuffer\fP when data type 
\%\f3GL_4D_COLOR_TEXTURE\fP is returned.
This also handles the case
where the \f2near\fP and \f2far\fP planes are different from the default,
0 and 1, respectively.
A return 
value of \%\f3GL_TRUE\fP indicates success; a return value of \%\f3GL_FALSE\fP
indicates failure.
.P
To compute the coordinates (\f2objX\fP, \f2objY\fP, \f2objZ\fP and \f2objW\fP),
\%\f3gluUnProject4\fP multiplies the normalized device coordinates by the inverse of
\f2model\fP*\f2proj\fP as follows:

.P
.ce
.EQ
left ( down 70 {cpile { ~"objX" above ~"objY" above ~"objZ"
above ~"objW"}} ~~ right ) ~=~ INV(P M) 
left ( down 140 {cpile { 
{ {2("winX" ~-~ "view"[0])} over {"view"[2]} ~-~ 1 }
above 
{ {2("winY" ~-~ "view"[1])} over {"view"[3]} ~-~ 1 }
above 
{ {2("winZ" ~-~ "near")} over {("far" ~-~ "near")} ~-~ 1 }
above 
"clipW"}} ~~ right )
.EN
.sp
$INV()$ denotes matrix inversion. 
.P
\%\f3gluUnProject4\fP is equivalent to \%\f3gluUnProject\fP when \f2clipW\fP is 1, \f2near\fP is 0 and
\f2far\fP is 1.
.SH NOTES
\%\f3gluUnProject4\fP is available only if the GLU version is 1.3 or greater.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

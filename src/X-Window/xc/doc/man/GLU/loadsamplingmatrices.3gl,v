.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\fIperspective\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2nurb\fP
Specifies the NURBS object (created with \%\f3gluNewNurbsRenderer\fP).
.TP
\f2model\fP
Specifies a modelview matrix (as from a \f3glGetFloatv\fP call).
.TP
\f2perspective\fP
Specifies a projection matrix (as from a \f3glGetFloatv\fP call).
.TP
\f2view\fP
Specifies a viewport (as from a \f3glGetIntegerv\fP call).
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3gluLoadSamplingMatrices\fP uses \f2model\fP, \f2perspective\fP, and \f2view\fP to recompute the sampling and culling 
matrices stored in \f2nurb\fP.
The sampling matrix determines how finely a NURBS curve or surface
must be tessellated to satisfy the sampling tolerance (as determined by the
\%\f3GLU_SAMPLING_TOLERANCE\fP property).
The culling matrix is used in deciding if a NURBS curve or surface
should be culled before 
rendering (when the \%\f3GLU_CULLING\fP property is turned on).
.P
\%\f3gluLoadSamplingMatrices\fP is necessary only if the \%\f3GLU_AUTO_LOAD_MATRIX\fP property is turned
off (see \%\f3gluNurbsProperty\fP).
Although it can be convenient to leave the \%\f3GLU_AUTO_LOAD_MATRIX\fP
property turned on, there can be a performance penalty for doing so.
(A round trip to the GL server is needed to fetch the current values
of the modelview matrix, projection matrix, and viewport.)

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

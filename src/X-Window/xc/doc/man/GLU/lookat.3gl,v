.TP \w'\f2eyeX\fP\ \f2eyeY\fP\ \f2eyeZ\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2eyeX\fP, \f2eyeY\fP, \f2eyeZ\fP
Specifies the position of the eye point.

.TP
\f2upX\fP, \f2upY\fP, \f2upZ\fP
Specifies the direction of the \f2up\fP vector.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3gluLookAt\fP creates a viewing matrix derived from an eye point, a reference
point indicating the center of the scene, and an \f2UP\fP vector.  
.P
The matrix
maps the reference point to the negative \f2z\fP axis and the
eye point to the origin.
When a typical projection matrix is used,
the center of the scene therefore maps to the center of the viewport.
Similarly, the direction described by the \f2UP\fP
vector projected onto the viewing plane is mapped to the positive \f2y\fP 
axis so that it points upward in the viewport.
The \f2UP\fP vector must not be parallel to the line of sight from the
eye point to the reference point.
.P
Let 
.sp
.EQ
F ~=~ left (  down 20 { ~ matrix {
   ccol {"centerX" above "centerY" above "centerZ"}
   ccol { ~-~ above ~-~ above ~-~}
   ccol {"eyeX" above "eyeY" above "eyeZ"}
} } ~~ right )

.EN

.sp
Let \f2UP\fP be the vector $("upX", "upY", "upZ")$. 
.P
Then normalize as follows: 
.EQ
f ~=~ F over {|| F ||}
.EN
.P
.EQ
UP sup prime ~=~ UP over {|| UP ||}
.EN
.sp
.P
Finally, let $s ~=~ f ~times~ UP sup prime$, and $u ~=~ s ~times~ f$.
.P
.sp
M is then constructed as follows:
.EQ
M ~=~ left (  matrix {
   ccol { ~s[0] above ~u[0] above -f[0] above 0 }
   ccol { ~s[1] above ~u[1] above -f[1] above 0 }
   ccol { ~s[2] above ~u[2] above -f[2] above 0 }
   ccol { 0 above 0 above 0  above 1 }
} ~~right )

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

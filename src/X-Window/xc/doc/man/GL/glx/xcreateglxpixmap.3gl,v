.EN
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\fIpixmap\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2dpy\fP
Specifies the connection to the X server.
.TP
\f2vis\fP
Specifies the visual that defines the structure of the rendering area.
It is a pointer to an \f3XVisualInfo\fP structure,
not a visual ID or a pointer to a \f3Visual\fP.
.TP
\f2pixmap\fP
Specifies the X pixmap that will be used as the front left color buffer
of the off-screen rendering area.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f3glXCreateGLXPixmap\fP creates an off-screen rendering area and returns its XID.
Any GLX rendering context that was created with respect to \f2vis\fP
can be used to render into this off-screen area.
Use \f3glXMakeCurrent\fP to associate the rendering area with a GLX
rendering context.
.P
The X pixmap identified by \f2pixmap\fP is used as the front left buffer of the
resulting off-screen rendering area.
All other buffers specified by \f2vis\fP,
including color buffers other than the front left buffer,
are created without externally visible names.
GLX pixmaps with double-buffering are supported.
However, \f3glXSwapBuffers\fP is ignored by these pixmaps.
.P
Some implementations may not support GLX pixmaps with direct rendering
contexts. 
.SH NOTES
\f3XVisualInfo\fP is defined in \f2Xutil.h.\fP
It is a structure that includes \f2visual\fP, \f2visualID\fP, \f2screen\fP, and
\f2depth\fP elements.
.SH ERRORS
\f3BadMatch\fP is generated if the depth of \f2pixmap\fP does not match
the depth value reported by core X11 for \f2vis\fP,
or if \f2pixmap\fP was not created with respect to the same screen as \f2vis\fP.
.P
\f3BadValue\fP is generated
if \f2vis\fP is not a valid XVisualInfo pointer (for example, if a
particular GLX implementation does not support this visual).
.P
\f3BadPixmap\fP is generated if \f2pixmap\fP is not a valid pixmap.
.P
\f3BadAlloc\fP is generated if the server cannot allocate the GLX
pixmap.
.SH SEE ALSO

\f3glXIsDirect\fP,

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

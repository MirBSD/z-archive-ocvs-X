\- return a string describing the client

.SH C SPECIFICATION
const char * \f3glXGetClientString\fP(
Display \fI*dpy\fP,
.nf
.ta \w'\f3const char * \fPglXGetClientString( 'u
	int \fIname\fP )

.EN
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\fIname\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2dpy\fP
Specifies the connection to the X server.
.TP
\f2name\fP
Specifies which string is returned.
One of \f3GLX_VENDOR\fP, \f3GLX_VERSION\fP, or \f3GLX_EXTENSIONS\fP.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f3glXGetClientString\fP returns a string
describing some aspect of the client library. The possible values for \f2name\fP 
are \f3GLX_VENDOR\fP, \f3GLX_VERSION\fP, and
\f3GLX_EXTENSIONS\fP. If \f2name\fP  
is not set to one of these values, \f3glXGetClientString\fP returns \f3NULL\fP. 
The format and contents of the vendor string is implementation dependent.
.P
The extensions string is null-terminated and contains a
space-separated list of  extension names. (The extension names never
contain spaces.)  
If there are no extensions to GLX, then the empty string is returned. 
.P
The version string is laid out as follows:
.sp
<major_version.minor_version><space><vendor-specific info>
.sp
Both the major and minor portions of the version number are of arbitrary 
length.  The vendor-specific information is optional.  However, if it is 
present, the format and contents are implementation specific.
.SH NOTES
\f3glXGetClientString\fP is available only if the GLX version is 1.1 or greater.
.P
If the GLX version is 1.1 or 1.0, the GL version must be 1.0.
If the GLX version is 1.2, then the GL version must be 1.1.
.P
\f3glXGetClientString\fP only returns information about GLX extensions supported by the client. 
Call \f3glGetString\fP to get a list of GL extensions supported by the server.
.SH SEE ALSO
\f3glXQueryVersion\fP,
\f3glXQueryExtensionsString\fP,

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

	GLXDrawable \fIdrawable\fP,
	GLXContext \fIctx\fP )
.fi

.EQ

.EN
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\fIdrawable\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2dpy\fP
Specifies the connection to the X server.
.TP
\f2drawable\fP
Specifies a GLX drawable.
Must be either an X window ID or a GLX pixmap ID.
.TP
\f2ctx\fP
Specifies a GLX rendering context that is to be attached to \f2drawable\fP.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f3glXMakeCurrent\fP does two things:
It makes \f2ctx\fP the current GLX rendering context of the calling thread,
replacing the previously current context if there was one,
and it attaches \f2ctx\fP to a GLX drawable,
either a window or a GLX pixmap.
As a result of these two actions,
subsequent GL rendering calls
use rendering context \f2ctx\fP to modify GLX drawable \f2drawable\fP.
Because \f3glXMakeCurrent\fP always replaces the current rendering context with \f2ctx\fP,
there can be only one current context per thread.
.P
Pending commands to the
previous context, if any, are flushed before it is released.
.P
The first time \f2ctx\fP is made current to any thread,
its viewport is set to the full size of \f2drawable\fP.
Subsequent calls by any thread to \f3glXMakeCurrent\fP with \f2ctx\fP
have no effect on its viewport.
.P
To release the current context without assigning a new one,
call \f3glXMakeCurrent\fP with \f2drawable\fP set \f3None\fP and \f2ctx\fP
set to \f3NULL\fP
.P
\f3glXMakeCurrent\fP returns \f3True\fP if it is successful,
\f3False\fP otherwise.
If \f3False\fP is returned, the previously current rendering context
and drawable (if any) remain unchanged.
.SH NOTES
A \f2process\fP is a single-execution environment,
implemented in a single address space,
consisting of one or more threads.
.P
A \f2thread\fP is one of a set of subprocesses that share
a single address space,
but maintain separate program counters,
stack spaces,
and other related global data.
A \f2thread\fP that is the only member of its subprocess group
is equivalent to a \f2process\fP.
.SH ERRORS
\f3BadMatch\fP is generated if \f2drawable\fP was not
created with the same X screen and visual as \f2ctx\fP.
It is also generated if \f2drawable\fP is \f3None\fP and \f2ctx\fP is not
\f3NULL\fP.
.P
\f3BadAccess\fP is generated if \f2ctx\fP was current to another thread
at the time \f3glXMakeCurrent\fP was called.
.P
\f3GLXBadDrawable\fP is generated if \f2drawable\fP is not a valid GLX drawable.
.P
\f3GLXBadContext\fP is generated if \f2ctx\fP is not a valid GLX context.
.P
\f3GLXBadContextState\fP is generated if \f3glXMakeCurrent\fP is executed between
the execution of \f3glBegin\fP and the corresponding execution of \f3glEnd\fP.
.P
\f3GLXBadContextState\fP is also generated if the rendering context current
to the calling thread has GL renderer state \f3GL_FEEDBACK\fP or
\f3GL_SELECT\fP.
.P
\f3GLXBadCurrentWindow\fP is generated if there are pending GL
commands for the previous context and the current drawable is
a window that is no longer valid.
.P
\f3BadAlloc\fP may be generated if the server has delayed allocation
of ancillary buffers until \f3glXMakeCurrent\fP is called, only to find that it has
insufficient resources to complete the allocation.
.SH SEE ALSO
\f3glXCreateContext\fP,
\f3glXCreateGLXPixmap\fP

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

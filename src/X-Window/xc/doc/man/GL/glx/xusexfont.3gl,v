.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\fIlistBase\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2font\fP
Specifies the font from which character glyphs are to be taken.
.TP
\f2first\fP
Specifies the index of the first glyph to be taken.
.TP
\f2count\fP
Specifies the number of glyphs to be taken.
.TP
\f2listBase\fP
Specifies the index of the first display list to be generated.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f3glXUseXFont\fP generates \f2count\fP display lists,
named \f2listBase\fP through \f2listBase\fP\&+\&\f2count\fP\&\-\&1,
each containing a single \f3glBitmap\fP command.
The parameters of the \f3glBitmap\fP command of display list \f2listBase\fP\&+\f2i\fP
are derived from glyph \f2first\fP\&+\f2i\fP.
Bitmap parameters \f2xorig, yorig, width,\fP and \f2height\fP
are computed from font metrics as
\f2descent\-1, \-lbearing,\fP
\f2rbearing\-lbearing,\fP and \f2ascent+descent\fP, respectively.
\f2xmove\fP is taken from the glyph's \f2width\fP metric,
and \f2ymove\fP is set to zero.
Finally,
the glyph's image is converted to the appropriate format for \f3glBitmap\fP.
.P
Using \f3glXUseXFont\fP may be more efficient than accessing the X font and generating
the display lists explicitly,
both because the display lists are created on the server without requiring
a round trip of the glyph data,
and because the server may choose to delay the creation of each
bitmap until it is accessed.
.P
Empty display lists are created for all glyphs that are requested and
are not defined in \f2font\fP.
\f3glXUseXFont\fP is ignored if there is no current GLX context.
.SH ERRORS
\f3BadFont\fP is generated if \f2font\fP is not a valid font.
.P
\f3GLXBadContextState\fP is generated if the current GLX context is
in display-list construction mode.
.P
\f3GLXBadCurrentWindow\fP is generated if the drawable associated
with the current context of the calling thread is a window, and that
window is no longer valid.
.SH SEE ALSO
\f3glBitmap\fP,
\f3glXMakeCurrent\fP

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.SH NAME
glXImportContextEXT
\- import another process's indirect rendering context.

.SH C SPECIFICATION
GLXContext \f3glXImportContextEXT\fP(
Display \fI*dpy\fP,
.nf
.ta \w'\f3GLXContext \fPglXImportContextEXT( 'u
	GLXContextID \fIcontextID\fP )

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\fIcontextID\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2dpy\fP
Specifies the connection to the X server.

.TP
\f2contextID\fP
Specifies a GLX rendering context.

.SH DESCRIPTION
\f3glXImportContextEXT\fP creates a GLXContext given the XID of an existing GLXContext.
It may be used in place of \f3glXCreateContext\fP,
to share another process's indirect rendering context.
.P
Only the server-side context information can be shared between
X clients; client-side state, such as pixel storage modes,
cannot be shared. Thus, \f3glXImportContextEXT\fP must allocate memory to store
client-side information. This memory is freed by calling
\f3glXFreeContextEXT\fP.
.P
This call does not create a new XID.  It merely makes an
existing object available to the importing client (Display *).
Like any XID, it goes away when the creating client drops its
connection or the ID is explicitly deleted. Note that this is
when the XID goes away. The object goes away when the XID
goes away AND the context is not current to any thread.
.P
If \f2contextID\fP refers to a
direct rendering context then no error is generated but
\f3glXImportContextEXT\fP returns NULL.
.P
\f3glXImportContextEXT\fP is part of the \f3EXT_import_context\fP extension,
not part of the core GLX command set. If \f3GLX_EXT_import_context\fP
is included in the string returned by \f3glXQueryExtensionsString\fP,
when called with argument \f3GLX_EXTENSIONS\fP,
extension \f3EXT_import_context\fP is supported.

.SH ERRORS
\f3GLXBadContext\fP is generated if \f2contextID\fP does not
refer to a valid context.

.SH SEE ALSO

\f3glXQueryVersion\fP,

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

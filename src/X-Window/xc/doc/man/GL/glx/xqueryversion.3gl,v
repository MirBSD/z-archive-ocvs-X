.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\fImajor\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2dpy\fP
Specifies the connection to the X server.
.TP
\f2major\fP
Returns the major version number of the GLX server extension.
.TP
\f2minor\fP
Returns the minor version number of the GLX server extension.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f3glXQueryVersion\fP returns the major and minor version numbers of the GLX extension
implemented by the server associated with connection \f2dpy\fP.
Implementations with the same major version number are upward compatible,
meaning that the implementation with the higher minor number is a superset
of the version with the lower minor number.
.P
\f2major\fP and \f2minor\fP do not return values if they are specified as
\f3NULL\fP. 
.SH ERRORS
\f3glXQueryVersion\fP returns \f3False\fP if it fails,
\f3True\fP otherwise.
.P
\f2major\fP and \f2minor\fP are not updated when \f3False\fP is returned.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

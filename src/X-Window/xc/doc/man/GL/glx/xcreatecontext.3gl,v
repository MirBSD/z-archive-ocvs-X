.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\fIshareList\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2dpy\fP
Specifies the connection to the X server.
.TP
\f2vis\fP
Specifies the visual that defines the frame buffer resources available to
the rendering context.
It is a pointer to an \f3XVisualInfo\fP structure,
not a visual ID or a pointer to a \f3Visual\fP.
.TP
\f2shareList\fP
Specifies the context with which to share display lists.
\f3NULL\fP indicates that no sharing is to take place.
.TP
\f2direct\fP
Specifies whether rendering is to be done with a direct connection
to the graphics system if possible (\f3True\fP)
or through the X server (\f3False\fP).
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f3glXCreateContext\fP creates a GLX rendering context and returns its handle.
This context can be used to render into both windows and GLX pixmaps.
If \f3glXCreateContext\fP fails to create a rendering context,
\f3NULL\fP is returned.
.P
If \f2direct\fP is \f3True\fP,
then a direct rendering context is created if the
implementation supports direct rendering, if the connection is to an X
server that is local, and if a direct rendering context is available. (An implementation may return an indirect context when \f2direct\fP is \f3True\fP).
If \f2direct\fP is \f3False\fP,
then a rendering context that renders through the X server is always created.
Direct rendering provides a performance advantage in some implementations.
However, direct rendering contexts cannot be shared outside a single process,
and they may be unable to render to GLX pixmaps.
.P
If \f2shareList\fP is not \f3NULL\fP,
then all display-list indexes and definitions are shared by
context \f2shareList\fP and by the newly created context.
An arbitrary number of contexts can share a single display-list space.
However,
all rendering contexts that share a single display-list space must
themselves exist in the same address space.
Two rendering contexts share an address space if both are nondirect
using the same server,
or if both are direct and owned by a single process.
Note that in the nondirect case, it is not necessary for the calling
threads to share an address space,
only for their related rendering contexts to share an address space.
.P  
If the GL version is 1.1 or greater, 
then all texture objects except object 0,  
are shared by any contexts that share display lists.
.SH NOTES
\f3XVisualInfo\fP is defined in \f2Xutil.h.\fP
It is a structure that includes \f2visual\fP, \f2visualID\fP, \f2screen\fP, and
\f2depth\fP elements.
.P
A \f2process\fP is a single execution environment,
implemented in a single address space,
consisting of one or more threads.
.P
A \f2thread\fP is one of a set of subprocesses that share
a single address space,
but maintain separate program counters,
stack spaces,
and other related global data.
A \f2thread\fP that is the only member of its subprocess group
is equivalent to a \f2process\fP.
.P
It may not be possible to render to a GLX pixmap with a direct rendering 
context.
.SH ERRORS
\f3NULL\fP is returned if execution fails on the client side.
.P
\f3BadMatch\fP is generated if the context to be created would not
share the address space or the screen of the context specified by \f2shareList\fP.
.P
\f3BadValue\fP is generated if \f2vis\fP is not a valid visual (for
example, if a particular GLX implementation does not support it).
.P
\f3GLXBadContext\fP is generated if \f2shareList\fP is not a GLX context
and is not \f3NULL\fP.
.P
\f3BadAlloc\fP is generated if the server does not have enough
resources to allocate the new context.
.SH SEE ALSO

\f3glXGetConfig\fP,
\f3glXIsDirect\fP,

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.SH NAME
.B "\- return a string describing the current GL connection

.SH C SPECIFICATION
const GLubyte* \f3glGetString\fP(
GLenum \fIname\fP )
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\fIname\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2name\fP
Specifies a symbolic constant, one of 
\%\f3GL_VENDOR\fP, \%\f3GL_RENDERER\fP, \%\f3GL_VERSION\fP, or \%\f3GL_EXTENSIONS\fP.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3glGetString\fP returns a pointer to a static string
describing some aspect of the current GL connection.
\f2name\fP can be one of the following:
.TP 20
\%\f3GL_VENDOR\fP
Returns the company responsible for this GL implementation.
This name does not change from release to release.
.TP
\%\f3GL_RENDERER\fP
Returns the name of the renderer.
This name is typically specific to a particular configuration of a hardware
platform.
It does not change from release to release.
.TP
\%\f3GL_VERSION\fP
Returns a version or release number.
.TP
\%\f3GL_EXTENSIONS\fP
Returns a space-separated list of supported extensions to GL.
.P
Because the GL does not include queries for the performance
characteristics of an implementation, some applications are written to
recognize known platforms and modify their GL usage based on known
performance characteristics of these platforms.
Strings \%\f3GL_VENDOR\fP and \%\f3GL_RENDERER\fP together uniquely specify
a platform. They do not change from release to release and should be used
by platform-recognition algorithms. 
.P
Some applications want to make use of features that
are not part of the standard GL. These features
may be implemented as extensions to the standard GL.
The \%\f3GL_EXTENSIONS\fP string is a space-separated
list of supported GL extensions.
(Extension names never contain a space character.)
.P
The \%\f3GL_VERSION\fP string begins with a version number.
The version number uses one
of these forms: 
.P
\f2major_number.minor_number\fP  
.br
\f2major_number.minor_number.release_number\fP
.P
Vendor-specific information may follow the version
number. Its  depends on the implementation, but 
a space always separates the version number and 
the vendor-specific information.
.P
All strings are null-terminated.
.SH NOTES
If an error is generated, \%\f3glGetString\fP returns 0.
.P
The client and server may support different versions or extensions.
\%\f3glGetString\fP always returns a compatible version number or list of extensions. 
The release number always describes the server.
.SH ERRORS
\%\f3GL_INVALID_ENUM\fP is generated if \f2name\fP is not an accepted value.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \%\f3glGetString\fP
is executed between the execution of \%\f3glBegin\fP
and the corresponding execution of \%\f3glEnd\fP.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.fi

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\f2target\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2target\fP
Specifies a texture environment.
Must be \%\f3GL_TEXTURE_ENV\fP.
.TP
\f2pname\fP
Specifies the symbolic name of a texture environment parameter.
Accepted values are \%\f3GL_TEXTURE_ENV_MODE\fP and \%\f3GL_TEXTURE_ENV_COLOR\fP.
.TP
\f2params\fP
Returns the requested data.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3glGetTexEnv\fP returns in \f2params\fP selected values of a texture environment that
was specified with \%\f3glTexEnv\fP.
\f2target\fP specifies a texture environment.
Currently, only one texture environment is defined and supported:
\%\f3GL_TEXTURE_ENV\fP. 
.P
\f2pname\fP names a specific texture environment parameter, as follows:
.TP 10
\%\f3GL_TEXTURE_ENV_MODE\fP
\f2params\fP returns the single-valued texture environment mode,
a symbolic constant. The initial value is \%\f3GL_MODULATE\fP.
.TP
\%\f3GL_TEXTURE_ENV_COLOR\fP
\f2params\fP returns four integer or floating-point values that are the
texture environment color.  
Integer values,
when requested,
are linearly mapped from the internal floating-point representation
such that 1.0 maps to the most positive representable integer,
and \-1.0 maps to the most negative representable integer. The initial
value is (0, 0, 0, 0).
.SH NOTES
If an error is generated,
no change is made to the contents of \f2params\fP.
.P
When the \%\f3GL_ARB_multitexture\fP extension is supported, \%\f3glGetTexEnv\fP returns
the texture environment parameters for the active texture unit.
.SH ERRORS
\%\f3GL_INVALID_ENUM\fP is generated if \f2target\fP or \f2pname\fP is not an
accepted value.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \%\f3glGetTexEnv\fP
is executed between the execution of \%\f3glBegin\fP
and the corresponding execution of \%\f3glEnd\fP.
.SH SEE ALSO

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

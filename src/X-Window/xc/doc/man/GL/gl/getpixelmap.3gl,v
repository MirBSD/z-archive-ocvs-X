.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\fIvalues\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2map\fP
Specifies the name of the pixel map to return.
Accepted values are
\%\f3GL_PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_I\fP,
\%\f3GL_PIXEL_MAP_S_TO_S\fP,
\%\f3GL_PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_R\fP,

\%\f3GL_PIXEL_MAP_B_TO_B\fP, and
\%\f3GL_PIXEL_MAP_A_TO_A\fP.
.TP
\f2values\fP
Returns the pixel map contents.
.SH DESCRIPTION
See the \%\f3glPixelMap\fP reference page for a description of the acceptable
values for the \f2map\fP parameter.
\%\f3glGetPixelMap\fP returns in \f2values\fP the contents of the pixel map
specified in \f2map\fP.
Pixel maps are used during the execution of
\%\f3glReadPixels\fP,
\%\f3glDrawPixels\fP,
\%\f3glCopyPixels\fP,
\%\f3glTexImage1D\fP,
\%\f3glTexImage2D\fP,
\%\f3glTexImage3D\fP,
\%\f3glTexSubImage1D\fP,
\%\f3glTexSubImage2D\fP,
\%\f3glTexSubImage3D\fP,
\%\f3glCopyTexImage1D\fP,
\%\f3glCopyTexImage2D\fP,
\%\f3glCopyTexSubImage1D\fP,
\%\f3glCopyTexSubImage2D\fP,
\%\f3glCopyTexSubImage3D\fP,
\%\f3glColorTable\fP,
\%\f3glColorSubTable\fP,
\%\f3glCopyColorTable\fP,
\%\f3glCopyColorSubTable\fP,
\%\f3glConvolutionFilter1D\fP,
\%\f3glConvolutionFilter2D\fP,
\%\f3glSeparableFilter2D\fP,
\%\f3glGetHistogram\fP,
\%\f3glGetMinmax\fP, and
\%\f3glGetTexImage\fP
to map color indices,
stencil indices,
color components,
and depth components to other values.
.P
Unsigned integer values,
if requested,
are linearly mapped from the internal fixed or floating-point representation
such that 1.0 maps to the largest representable integer value,
and 0.0 maps to 0.
Return unsigned integer values are undefined if the map value was
not in the range [0,1].
.P
To determine the required size of \f2map\fP,
call \%\f3glGet\fP with the appropriate symbolic constant.
.SH NOTES
If an error is generated,
no change is made to the contents of \f2values\fP.
.SH ERRORS
\%\f3GL_INVALID_ENUM\fP is generated if \f2map\fP is not an accepted value.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \%\f3glGetPixelMap\fP
is executed between the execution of \%\f3glBegin\fP
and the corresponding execution of \%\f3glEnd\fP.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

1.1.1.1
log
@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

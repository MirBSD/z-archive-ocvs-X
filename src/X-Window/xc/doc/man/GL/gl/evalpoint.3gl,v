\f2i\fP
Specifies the integer value for grid domain variable $i$.
.TP
\f2j\fP
Specifies the integer value for grid domain variable $j$
(\%\f3glEvalPoint2\fP only).
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3glMapGrid\fP and \%\f3glEvalMesh\fP are used in tandem to efficiently
generate and evaluate a series of evenly spaced map domain values.
\%\f3glEvalPoint\fP can be used to evaluate a single grid point in the same gridspace
that is traversed by \%\f3glEvalMesh\fP.
Calling \%\f3glEvalPoint1\fP is equivalent to calling
.nf
.IP
\f7
glEvalCoord1( i$^cdot^DELTA u ~+~ u sub 1$ );
\fP
.RE
.fi
where
.sp
.in
$DELTA u ~=~ ( u sub 2 - u sub 1 ) ^/^ n$
.in 0
.sp
.P
and $n$, $u sub 1$, and $u sub 2$
are the arguments to the most recent \%\f3glMapGrid1\fP command.
The one absolute numeric requirement is that if $i~=~n$,
then the value computed from 
$i ^cdot^ DELTA u ~+~ u sub 1$ is exactly $u sub 2$.
.P
In the two-dimensional case, \%\f3glEvalPoint2\fP, let 
.nf
.IP
$DELTA u ~=~ mark ( u sub 2 - u sub 1 ) ^/^ n$
.sp
$DELTA v ~=~ mark ( v sub 2 - v sub 1 ) ^/^ m,$
.RE
.fi
.P
where $n$, $u sub 1$, $u sub 2$, $m$, $v sub 1$, and $v sub 2$
are the arguments to the most recent \%\f3glMapGrid2\fP command.
Then the \%\f3glEvalPoint2\fP command is equivalent to calling
.nf
.IP
\f7
glEvalCoord2( i$^cdot^DELTA u ~+~ u sub 1$, j$^cdot^DELTA v ~+~ v sub 1$ );
\fP
.RE
.fi
The only absolute numeric requirements are that if $i~=~n$,
then the value computed from
$i ^cdot^DELTA u ~+~ u sub 1$ is exactly $u sub 2$,
and if $j~=~m$, then the value computed from 
$i ^cdot^DELTA v ~+~ v sub 1$ is exactly $v sub 2$.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

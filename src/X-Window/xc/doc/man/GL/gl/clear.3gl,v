.SH NAME
.B "glClear
\- clear buffers to preset values

.SH C SPECIFICATION
void \f3glClear\fP(
GLbitfield \fImask\fP )
.nf
.fi

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\f2mask\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2mask\fP
Bitwise OR of masks that indicate the buffers to be cleared.
The four masks are
\%\f3GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT\fP,
\%\f3GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT\fP,
\%\f3GL_ACCUM_BUFFER_BIT\fP, and
\%\f3GL_STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT\fP.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3glClear\fP sets the bitplane area of the window to values previously selected
by \%\f3glClearColor\fP, \%\f3glClearIndex\fP, \%\f3glClearDepth\fP, 
\%\f3glClearStencil\fP, and \%\f3glClearAccum\fP.
Multiple color buffers can be cleared simultaneously by selecting
more than one buffer at a time using \%\f3glDrawBuffer\fP.
.P
The pixel ownership test,
the scissor test,
dithering, and the buffer writemasks affect the operation of \%\f3glClear\fP.
The scissor box bounds the cleared region.
Alpha function,
blend function,
logical operation,
stenciling,
texture mapping,
and depth-buffering are ignored by \%\f3glClear\fP.
.P
\%\f3glClear\fP takes a single argument that is the bitwise OR of several
values indicating which buffer is to be cleared.
.P
The values are as follows: 
.TP 28
\%\f3GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT\fP
Indicates the buffers currently enabled for color
writing.
.TP
\%\f3GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT\fP
Indicates the depth buffer.
.TP
\%\f3GL_ACCUM_BUFFER_BIT\fP
Indicates the accumulation buffer. 
.TP
\%\f3GL_STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT\fP
Indicates the stencil buffer.
.P
The value to which each buffer is cleared depends on the setting of the
clear value for that buffer.  
.SH NOTES
If a buffer is not present,
then a \%\f3glClear\fP directed at that buffer has no effect.
.SH ERRORS
\%\f3GL_INVALID_VALUE\fP is generated if any bit other than the four defined
bits is set in \f2mask\fP.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \%\f3glClear\fP
is executed between the execution of \%\f3glBegin\fP
and the corresponding execution of \%\f3glEnd\fP.
.SH ASSOCIATED GETS
\%\f3glGet\fP with argument \%\f3GL_ACCUM_CLEAR_VALUE\fP
.br
\%\f3glGet\fP with argument \%\f3GL_DEPTH_CLEAR_VALUE\fP
.br
\%\f3glGet\fP with argument \%\f3GL_INDEX_CLEAR_VALUE\fP
.br
\%\f3glGet\fP with argument \%\f3GL_COLOR_CLEAR_VALUE\fP

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

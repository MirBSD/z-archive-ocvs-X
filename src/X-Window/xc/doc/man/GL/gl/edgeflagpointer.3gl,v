.SH NAME
.B "glEdgeFlagPointer
\- define an array of edge flags

.SH C SPECIFICATION
void \f3glEdgeFlagPointer\fP(
GLsizei \fIstride\fP,
.nf
.ta \w'\f3void \fPglEdgeFlagPointer( 'u
	const GLvoid \fI*ptr\fP )
.fi

.EQ
delim $$
.EN
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\f2stride\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2stride\fP
Specifies the byte offset between consecutive edge flags.
If \f2stride\fP is 0 (the initial value), the edge flags are understood
to be tightly packed in the array. The initial value is 0.
.TP
\f2ptr\fP
Specifies a pointer to the first edge flag in the array. The initial
value is zero.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3glEdgeFlagPointer\fP specifies the location and data  of an array of boolean edge 
flags to use when rendering. \f2stride\fP specifies the byte stride from one
edge flag to the next allowing vertices and attributes
to be packed into a single array or stored in separate arrays.
(Single-array storage may be more efficient on some implementations;
see \%\f3glInterleavedArrays\fP.)
.P
When an edge flag array is
specified, \f2stride\fP and \f2ptr\fP are saved as client-side
state.
.P
To enable and disable the edge flag array, call \%\f3glEnableClientState\fP and
.br
\%\f3glDisableClientState\fP with 
the argument \%\f3GL_EDGE_FLAG_ARRAY\fP. If enabled, the edge flag array is used
when \%\f3glDrawArrays\fP, \%\f3glDrawElements\fP, or \%\f3glArrayElement\fP is called.
.P
Use \%\f3glDrawArrays\fP to construct a sequence of primitives (all of
the same type)
from prespecified vertex and vertex attribute arrays.
Use \%\f3glArrayElement\fP to specify primitives
by indexing vertices and vertex attributes and \%\f3glDrawElements\fP to
construct a sequence of primitives by indexing vertices and vertex attributes.
.SH NOTES
\%\f3glEdgeFlagPointer\fP is available only if the GL version is 1.1 or greater.
.P
The edge flag array is initially disabled and it won't be accessed when
.br
\%\f3glArrayElement\fP, \%\f3glDrawElements\fP or \%\f3glDrawArrays\fP is called.
.P
Execution of \%\f3glEdgeFlagPointer\fP is not allowed between the execution of
\%\f3glBegin\fP and the corresponding execution of \%\f3glEnd\fP,
but an error may or may not be generated. If no error is generated,
the operation is undefined.
.P
\%\f3glEdgeFlagPointer\fP is typically implemented on the client side.
.P
Edge flag array parameters are client-side state and are therefore
not saved or restored by \%\f3glPushAttrib\fP and \%\f3glPopAttrib\fP.
Use \%\f3glPushClientAttrib\fP and 
.br
\%\f3glPopClientAttrib\fP instead.
.SH ERRORS
\%\f3GL_INVALID_ENUM\fP is generated if \f2stride\fP is negative.
.SH ASSOCIATED GETS  
\%\f3glIsEnabled\fP with argument \%\f3GL_EDGE_FLAG_ARRAY\fP
.br
\%\f3glGet\fP with argument \%\f3GL_EDGE_FLAG_ARRAY_STRIDE\fP
.br
\%\f3glGetPointerv\fP with argument \%\f3GL_EDGE_FLAG_ARRAY_POINTER\fP

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

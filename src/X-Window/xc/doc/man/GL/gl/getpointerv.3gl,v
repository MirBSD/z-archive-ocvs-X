.TP
\f2params\fP
Returns the pointer value specified by \f2pname\fP.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3glGetPointerv\fP returns pointer information. \f2pname\fP 
is a symbolic constant indicating the pointer to be returned, and
\f2params\fP is a pointer to a location in which to place the returned data. 
.SH NOTES
\%\f3glGetPointerv\fP is available only if the GL version is 1.1 or greater.
.P
The pointers are all client-side state.
.P
The initial value for each pointer is 0. 
.P
When the \%\f3GL_ARB_multitexture\fP extension is supported, querying the
\%\f3GL_TEXTURE_COORD_ARRAY_POINTER\fP returns the value for the active
client texture unit.
.SH ERRORS
\%\f3GL_INVALID_ENUM\fP is generated if \f2pname\fP is not an accepted value.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\f2near_val\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2near_val\fP
Specifies the mapping of the near clipping plane to window coordinates.
The initial value is 0.
.TP
\f2far_val\fP
Specifies the mapping of the far clipping plane to window coordinates.
The initial value is 1.
.SH DESCRIPTION
After clipping and division by \f2w\fP,
depth coordinates range from \-1 to 1,
corresponding to the near and far clipping planes.
\%\f3glDepthRange\fP specifies a linear mapping of the normalized depth coordinates
in this range to window depth coordinates.
Regardless of the actual depth buffer implementation,
window coordinate depth values are treated as though they range
from 0 through 1 (like color components).
Thus,
the values accepted by \%\f3glDepthRange\fP are both clamped to this range
before they are accepted.
.P
The setting of (0,1) maps the near plane to 0 and
the far plane to 1.
With this mapping,
the depth buffer range is fully utilized.
.SH NOTES
It is not necessary that \f2near_val\fP be less than \f2far_val\fP.
Reverse mappings such as $"near_val" ~=~ 1$, and $"far_val" ~=~ 0$
are acceptable.
.SH ERRORS
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \%\f3glDepthRange\fP
is executed between the execution of \%\f3glBegin\fP
and the corresponding execution of \%\f3glEnd\fP.
.SH ASSOCIATED GETS
\%\f3glGet\fP with argument \%\f3GL_DEPTH_RANGE\fP

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

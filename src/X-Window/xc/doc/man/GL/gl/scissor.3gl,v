.SH NAME
.B "glScissor
\- define the scissor box

.SH C SPECIFICATION
void \f3glScissor\fP(
GLint \fIx\fP,
.nf
.ta \w'\f3void \fPglScissor( 'u
	GLint \fIy\fP,
	GLsizei \fIwidth\fP,
	GLsizei \fIheight\fP )
.fi

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\f2x\fP\ \f2y\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2x\fP, \f2y\fP 
Specify the lower left corner of the scissor box.
Initially (0, 0).
.TP
\f2width\fP, \f2height\fP
Specify the width and height of the scissor box.
When a GL context is first attached to a window,
\f2width\fP and \f2height\fP are set to the dimensions of that window.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3glScissor\fP defines a rectangle, called the scissor box,
in window coordinates.
The first two arguments,
\f2x\fP and \f2y\fP,
specify the lower left corner of the box.
\f2width\fP and \f2height\fP specify the width and height of the box. 
.P
To enable and disable the scissor test, call
\%\f3glEnable\fP and \%\f3glDisable\fP with argument
\%\f3GL_SCISSOR_TEST\fP. The test is initially disabled. 
While the test is enabled, only pixels that lie within the scissor box
can be modified by drawing commands.
Window coordinates have integer values at the shared corners of
frame buffer pixels.
\f7glScissor(0,0,1,1)\fP allows modification of only the lower left
pixel in the window, and \f7glScissor(0,0,0,0)\fP doesn't allow
modification of any pixels in the window.  
.P
When the scissor test is disabled,
it is as though the scissor box includes the entire window.
.SH ERRORS
\%\f3GL_INVALID_VALUE\fP is generated if either \f2width\fP or \f2height\fP is negative.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \%\f3glScissor\fP
is executed between the execution of \%\f3glBegin\fP
and the corresponding execution of \%\f3glEnd\fP.
.bp
.SH ASSOCIATED GETS
\%\f3glGet\fP with argument \%\f3GL_SCISSOR_BOX\fP
.br
\%\f3glIsEnabled\fP with argument \%\f3GL_SCISSOR_TEST\fP
.SH SEE ALSO

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

\f2target\fP
The filter to be retrieved.
Must be one of

\%\f3GL_UNSIGNED_INT_2_10_10_10_REV\fP
are accepted.
.TP
\f2image\fP
Pointer to storage for the output image.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3glGetConvolutionFilter\fP returns the current 1D or 2D convolution filter kernel as an image.
The one- or two-dimensional image is placed in \f2image\fP according to the
specifications in \f2format\fP and \f2type\fP.
No pixel transfer operations are performed on this image, but the relevant
pixel storage modes are applied.
.sp
Color components that are present in \f2format\fP but not included in the
internal  of the filter are returned as zero.
The assignments of internal color components to the components of \f2format\fP
are as follows.

.SH NOTES
\%\f3glGetConvolutionFilter\fP is present only if \%\f3GL_ARB_imaging\fP is returned when \%\f3glGetString\fP
is called with an argument of \%\f3GL_EXTENSIONS\fP.
.P
The current separable 2D filter must be retrieved with
\%\f3glGetSeparableFilter\fP rather than \%\f3glGetConvolutionFilter\fP.
.SH ERRORS
\%\f3GL_INVALID_ENUM\fP is generated if \f2target\fP is not one of the allowable
values.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_ENUM\fP is generated if \f2format\fP is not one of the allowable
values.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_ENUM\fP is generated if \f2type\fP is not one of the allowable
values.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \%\f3glGetConvolutionFilter\fP is executed
between the execution of \%\f3glBegin\fP and the corresponding
execution of \%\f3glEnd\fP.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \f2type\fP is one of
\%\f3GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE_3_3_2\fP,
\%\f3GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE_2_3_3_REV\fP,
\%\f3GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_6_5\fP, or
\%\f3GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_6_5_REV\fP
and \f2format\fP is not \%\f3GL_RGB\fP.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \f2type\fP is one of

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\f2mask\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2mask\fP
Specifies a pointer to a $32 ~times~ 32$ stipple pattern that will be unpacked
from memory in the same way that \%\f3glDrawPixels\fP unpacks pixels.
.SH DESCRIPTION
Polygon stippling,
like line stippling
(see \%\f3glLineStipple\fP),
masks out certain fragments produced by rasterization,
creating a pattern.
Stippling is independent of polygon antialiasing.
.P
\f2mask\fP is a pointer to a $32 ~times~ 32$ stipple pattern that is stored
in memory just like the pixel data supplied to a \%\f3glDrawPixels\fP
call with 
.I
height
and
.I width
both equal to 32, a pixel 
of \%\f3GL_COLOR_INDEX\fP, and data type 
of \%\f3GL_BITMAP\fP.
That is,
the stipple pattern is represented as a $32 ~times~ 32$ array
of 1-bit color indices packed in unsigned bytes.
\%\f3glPixelStore\fP parameters like \%\f3GL_UNPACK_SWAP_BYTES\fP
and \%\f3GL_UNPACK_LSB_FIRST\fP affect the assembling of the bits into a
stipple pattern.
Pixel transfer operations
(shift, offset, pixel map)
are not applied to the stipple image,
however.
.P
To enable and disable polygon stippling, call
\%\f3glEnable\fP and \%\f3glDisable\fP
with argument \%\f3GL_POLYGON_STIPPLE\fP. Polygon stippling is initially
disabled. If it's enabled,
a rasterized polygon fragment with window coordinates $x sub w$ and $y sub w$
is sent to the next stage of the GL if and only if the
($x sub w~roman mod~32$)th bit in the ($y sub w~roman mod~32$)th row
of the stipple pattern is 1 (one).
When polygon stippling is disabled, it is as if the stipple pattern
consists of all 1's.
.SH ERRORS
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \%\f3glPolygonStipple\fP
is executed between the execution of \%\f3glBegin\fP
and the corresponding execution of \%\f3glEnd\fP.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

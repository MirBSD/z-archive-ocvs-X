.SH NAME
.B "glSelectBuffer
\- establish a buffer for selection mode values

.SH C SPECIFICATION
void \f3glSelectBuffer\fP(
GLsizei \fIsize\fP,
.nf
.ta \w'\f3void \fPglSelectBuffer( 'u
	GLuint \fI*buffer\fP )
.fi

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\fIbuffer\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2size\fP
Specifies the size of \f2buffer\fP.
.TP
\f2buffer\fP
Returns the selection data.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3glSelectBuffer\fP has two arguments:
\f2buffer\fP is a pointer to an array of unsigned integers,
and \f2size\fP indicates the size of the array.
\f2buffer\fP returns values from the name stack
(see \%\f3glInitNames\fP, \%\f3glLoadName\fP, \%\f3glPushName\fP)
when the rendering mode is \%\f3GL_SELECT\fP (see \%\f3glRenderMode\fP).
\%\f3glSelectBuffer\fP must be issued before selection mode is enabled,
and it must not be issued while the rendering mode is \%\f3GL_SELECT\fP.
.P
A programmer can use selection to determine which primitives
are drawn into some region of a window.
The region is defined by the current modelview and perspective matrices. 
.P
In selection mode, no pixel fragments are produced from rasterization.
Instead,
if a primitive or a raster position intersects the clipping 
volume defined by the viewing frustum
and the user-defined clipping planes,
this primitive causes a selection hit.
(With polygons, no hit occurs if the polygon is culled.)
When a change is made to the name stack,
or when \%\f3glRenderMode\fP is called,
a hit record is copied to \f2buffer\fP if any hits have occurred since the
last such event
(name stack change or 
\%\f3glRenderMode\fP call).
The hit record consists of the number of names in the name stack at the
time of the event, followed by the minimum and maximum depth values
of all vertices that hit since the previous event,
followed by the name stack contents,
bottom name first.
.P
Depth values (which are in the range [0,1]) are multiplied by 2^32 - 1,
before being placed in the hit record.
.P
An internal index into \f2buffer\fP is reset to 0 whenever selection mode
is entered.
Each time a hit record is copied into \f2buffer\fP,
the index is incremented to point to the cell just past the end
of the block of names \- that is, to the next available cell.
If the hit record is larger than the number of remaining locations in \f2buffer\fP,
as much data as can fit is copied,
and the overflow flag is set.
If the name stack is empty when a hit record is copied,
that record consists of 0 followed by the minimum and maximum depth values.
.P
To exit selection mode, call \%\f3glRenderMode\fP with an argument
other than \%\f3GL_SELECT\fP.
Whenever \%\f3glRenderMode\fP is called while the render mode is \%\f3GL_SELECT\fP,
it returns the number of hit records copied to \f2buffer\fP,
resets the overflow flag and the selection buffer pointer,
and initializes the name stack to be empty.
If the overflow bit was set when \%\f3glRenderMode\fP was called,
a negative hit record count is returned.
.SH NOTES
The contents of \f2buffer\fP is undefined until \%\f3glRenderMode\fP is called
with an argument other than \%\f3GL_SELECT\fP.
.P
\%\f3glBegin\fP/\%\f3glEnd\fP primitives and calls to \%\f3glRasterPos\fP
can result in hits.
.SH ERRORS
\%\f3GL_INVALID_VALUE\fP is generated if \f2size\fP is negative.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \%\f3glSelectBuffer\fP is called while the
render mode is \%\f3GL_SELECT\fP,
or if \%\f3glRenderMode\fP is called with argument \%\f3GL_SELECT\fP before
\%\f3glSelectBuffer\fP is called at least once.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \%\f3glSelectBuffer\fP
is executed between the execution of \%\f3glBegin\fP
and the corresponding execution of \%\f3glEnd\fP.
.SH ASSOCIATED GETS
\%\f3glGet\fP with argument \%\f3GL_NAME_STACK_DEPTH\fP

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

1.1.1.1
log
@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

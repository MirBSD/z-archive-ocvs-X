.EN
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\f2width\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2width\fP
Specifies the width of rasterized lines.
The initial value is 1.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3glLineWidth\fP specifies the rasterized width of both aliased and antialiased
lines.
Using a line width other than 1 has different effects,
depending on whether line antialiasing is enabled.
To enable and disable line antialiasing, call 
\%\f3glEnable\fP and \%\f3glDisable\fP
with argument \%\f3GL_LINE_SMOOTH\fP. Line antialiasing is initially
disabled. 
.P
If line antialiasing is disabled,
the actual width is determined by rounding the supplied width
to the nearest integer.
(If the rounding results in the value 0,
it is as if the line width were 1.)
If
$| DELTA x | ~>=~ | DELTA y |$,
\f2i\fP pixels are filled in each column that is rasterized,
where \f2i\fP is the rounded value of \f2width\fP.
Otherwise,
\f2i\fP pixels are filled in each row that is rasterized.
.P
If antialiasing is enabled,
line rasterization produces a fragment for each pixel square
that intersects the region lying within the rectangle having width
equal to the current line width,
length equal to the actual length of the line,
and centered on the mathematical line segment.
The coverage value for each fragment is the window coordinate area
of the intersection of the rectangular region with the corresponding
pixel square.
This value is saved and used in the final rasterization step. 
.P
Not all widths can be supported when line antialiasing is enabled. If an
unsupported width is requested, the nearest supported width is used.
Only width 1 is guaranteed to be supported; others depend on the
implementation.  Likewise, there is a range for aliased line widths as well.
To query the range of supported widths and the size
difference between supported widths within the range, call \%\f3glGet\fP
with arguments \%\f3GL_ALIASED_LINE_WIDTH_RANGE\fP,
\%\f3GL_SMOOTH_LINE_WIDTH_RANGE\fP, \%\f3GL_SMOOTH_LINE_WIDTH_GRANULARITY\fP.
.SH NOTES
The line width specified by \%\f3glLineWidth\fP is always returned when \%\f3GL_LINE_WIDTH\fP
is queried.
Clamping and rounding for aliased and antialiased lines have no effect
on the specified value.
.P
Nonantialiased line width may be clamped to an implementation-dependent
maximum.  Call \%\f3glGet\fP with \%\f3GL_ALIASED_LINE_WIDTH_RANGE\fP to
determine the maximum width.
.SH ERRORS
\%\f3GL_INVALID_VALUE\fP is generated if \f2width\fP is less than or equal to 0.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \%\f3glLineWidth\fP
is executed between the execution of \%\f3glBegin\fP
and the corresponding execution of \%\f3glEnd\fP.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

\f2target\fP
The filter whose parameters are to be retrieved.

\%\f3GL_CONVOLUTION_2D\fP, or
\%\f3GL_SEPARABLE_2D\fP.

.TP
\f2params\fP
Pointer to storage for the parameters to be retrieved.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3glGetConvolutionParameter\fP retrieves convolution parameters.
\f2target\fP determines which convolution filter is queried.
\f2pname\fP determines which parameter is returned:
.TP
\%\f3GL_CONVOLUTION_BORDER_MODE\fP
The convolution border mode.
See \%\f3glConvolutionParameter\fP for a list of border modes.
.TP
\%\f3GL_CONVOLUTION_BORDER_COLOR\fP
The current convolution border color.
\f2params\fP must be a pointer to an array of four elements,
which will receive the red, green, blue, and alpha border colors.
.TP
\%\f3GL_CONVOLUTION_FILTER_SCALE\fP
The current filter scale factors.
\f2params\fP must be a pointer to an array of four elements,
which will receive the red, green, blue, and alpha filter scale
factors in that order.
.TP
\%\f3GL_CONVOLUTION_FILTER_BIAS\fP
The current filter bias factors.
\f2params\fP must be a pointer to an array of four elements,
which will receive the red, green, blue, and alpha filter bias
terms in that order.
.TP
\%\f3GL_CONVOLUTION_FORMAT\fP
The current internal .
See \%\f3glConvolutionFilter1D\fP, \%\f3glConvolutionFilter2D\fP,
and \%\f3glSeparableFilter2D\fP for lists of allowable formats.
.TP
\%\f3GL_CONVOLUTION_WIDTH\fP
The current filter image width.
.TP
\%\f3GL_CONVOLUTION_HEIGHT\fP
The current filter image height.
.TP
\%\f3GL_MAX_CONVOLUTION_WIDTH\fP
The maximum acceptable filter image width.
.TP
\%\f3GL_MAX_CONVOLUTION_HEIGHT\fP
The maximum acceptable filter image height.
.SH ERRORS
\%\f3GL_INVALID_ENUM\fP is generated if \f2target\fP is not one of the allowable
values.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_ENUM\fP is generated if \f2pname\fP is not one of the allowable
values.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_ENUM\fP is generated if \f2target\fP is \%\f3GL_CONVOLUTION_1D\fP
and \f2pname\fP is \%\f3GL_CONVOLUTION_HEIGHT\fP or
\%\f3GL_MAX_CONVOLUTION_HEIGHT\fP.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \%\f3glGetConvolutionParameter\fP is executed
between the execution of \%\f3glBegin\fP and the corresponding
execution of \%\f3glEnd\fP.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

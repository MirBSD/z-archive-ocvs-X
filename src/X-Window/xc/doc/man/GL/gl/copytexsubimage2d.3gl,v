.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\fIxoffset\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2target\fP
Specifies the target texture.
Must be \%\f3GL_TEXTURE_2D\fP.
.TP
\f2level\fP
Specifies the level-of-detail number.
Level 0 is the base image level.
Level \f2n\fP is the \f2n\fPth mipmap reduction image.
.TP
\f2xoffset\fP
Specifies a texel offset in the x direction within the texture array.
.TP
\f2yoffset\fP
Specifies a texel offset in the y direction within the texture array.
.TP
\f2x\fP, \f2y\fP
Specify the window coordinates of the lower left corner
of the rectangular region of pixels to be copied.
.TP
\f2width\fP
Specifies the width of the texture subimage.
.TP
\f2height\fP
Specifies the height of the texture subimage.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3glCopyTexSubImage2D\fP replaces a rectangular portion of a two-dimensional
texture image with pixels from the current \%\f3GL_READ_BUFFER\fP (rather
than from main memory, as is the case for \%\f3glTexSubImage2D\fP).
.P
The screen-aligned pixel rectangle with lower left corner at
(\f2x\fP,\ \f2y\fP) and with
width \f2width\fP and height \f2height\fP replaces the portion of the
texture array with x indices \f2xoffset\fP through \f2xoffset\fP$~+~$\f2width\fP$~-~$1,
inclusive, and y indices \f2yoffset\fP through \f2yoffset\fP$~+~$\f2height\fP$~-~$1,
inclusive, at the mipmap level specified by \f2level\fP.
.P
The pixels in the rectangle are processed exactly as if
\%\f3glCopyPixels\fP had been called, but the process stops just before
final conversion.
At this point, all pixel component values are clamped to the range [0,\ 1]
and then converted to the texture's internal  for storage in the texel
array.
.P
The destination rectangle in the texture array may not include any texels
outside the texture array as it was originally specified.
It is not an error to specify a subtexture with zero width or height, but
such a specification has no effect.
.P
If any of the pixels within the specified rectangle of the current
\%\f3GL_READ_BUFFER\fP are outside the read window associated with the current
rendering context, then the values obtained for those pixels are undefined.
.P
No change is made to the \f2internalformat\fP, \f2width\fP,
\f2height\fP, or \f2border\fP parameters of the specified texture
array or to texel values outside the specified subregion.
.SH NOTES
\%\f3glCopyTexSubImage2D\fP is available only if the GL version is 1.1 or greater. 
.P
Texturing has no effect in color index mode.
.P
\%\f3glPixelStore\fP and \%\f3glPixelTransfer\fP modes affect texture images
in exactly the way they affect \%\f3glDrawPixels\fP.
.P
When the \%\f3GL_ARB_imaging\fP extension is supported, the RGBA components
read from the framebuffer may be processed by the imaging pipeline.  See
\%\f3glTexImage1D\fP for specific details.
.SH ERRORS
\%\f3GL_INVALID_ENUM\fP is generated if \f2target\fP is not \%\f3GL_TEXTURE_2D\fP. 
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if the texture array has not
been defined by a previous \%\f3glTexImage2D\fP or \%\f3glCopyTexImage2D\fP operation.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_VALUE\fP is generated if \f2level\fP is less than 0.
.P 
\%\f3GL_INVALID_VALUE\fP may be generated if \f2level\fP is greater
than $log sub 2 max$,
where $max$ is the returned value of \%\f3GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE\fP.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_VALUE\fP is generated if \f2x\fP$ ~<~ ~-b$ or if
\f2y\fP$ ~<~ ~-b$, 
where $b$ is the border width of the texture array.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_VALUE\fP is generated if $"xoffset" ~<~ -b$,
(\f2xoffset\fP$~+~$\f2width\fP)$~>~(w ~-~b)$, 
\f2yoffset\fP$~<~ ~-b$, or 
(\f2yoffset\fP$~+~$\f2height\fP)$~>~(h ~-~b)$,
where $w$ is the \%\f3GL_TEXTURE_WIDTH\fP, 
$h$ is the  \%\f3GL_TEXTURE_HEIGHT\fP, 
and $b$ is the \%\f3GL_TEXTURE_BORDER\fP
of the texture image being modified.
Note that $w$ and $h$
include twice the border width.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \%\f3glCopyTexSubImage2D\fP is executed
between the execution of \%\f3glBegin\fP and the corresponding
execution of \%\f3glEnd\fP.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

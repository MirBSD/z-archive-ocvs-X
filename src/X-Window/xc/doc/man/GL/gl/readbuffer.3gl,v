.SH NAME
.B "glReadBuffer
\- select a color buffer source for pixels

.SH C SPECIFICATION
void \f3glReadBuffer\fP(
GLenum \fImode\fP )
.nf
.fi

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\f2mode\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2mode\fP
Specifies a color buffer.
Accepted values are
\%\f3GL_FRONT_LEFT\fP,
\%\f3GL_FRONT_RIGHT\fP,
\%\f3GL_BACK_LEFT\fP,
\%\f3GL_BACK_RIGHT\fP,
\%\f3GL_FRONT\fP,
\%\f3GL_BACK\fP,
\%\f3GL_LEFT\fP,
\%\f3GL_RIGHT\fP, and
\%\f3GL_AUX\fP\f2i\fP,
where \f2i\fP is between 0 and \%\f3GL_AUX_BUFFERS\fP \-1.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3glReadBuffer\fP specifies a color buffer as the source for subsequent
\%\f3glReadPixels\fP, \%\f3glCopyTexImage1D\fP, \%\f3glCopyTexImage2D\fP,
\%\f3glCopyTexSubImage1D\fP, \%\f3glCopyTexSubImage2D\fP,
\%\f3glCopyTexSubImage3D\fP, and
\%\f3glCopyPixels\fP commands. 
\f2mode\fP accepts one of twelve or more predefined values.
(\%\f3GL_AUX0\fP through \%\f3GL_AUX3\fP are always defined.)
In a fully configured system,
\%\f3GL_FRONT\fP,
\%\f3GL_LEFT\fP, and
\%\f3GL_FRONT_LEFT\fP all name the front left buffer,
\%\f3GL_FRONT_RIGHT\fP and
\%\f3GL_RIGHT\fP name the front right buffer, and
\%\f3GL_BACK_LEFT\fP and
\%\f3GL_BACK\fP name the back left buffer.
.P
Nonstereo double-buffered configurations have only a front left and a
back left buffer.
Single-buffered configurations have a front left and a front right 
buffer if stereo, and only a front left buffer if nonstereo.
It is an error to specify a nonexistent buffer to \%\f3glReadBuffer\fP.
.P
\f2mode\fP is initially \%\f3GL_FRONT\fP in single-buffered configurations,
and \%\f3GL_BACK\fP in double-buffered configurations.
.SH ERRORS
\%\f3GL_INVALID_ENUM\fP is generated if \f2mode\fP is not one of the twelve
(or more) accepted values.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \f2mode\fP specifies a buffer
that does not exist.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \%\f3glReadBuffer\fP
is executed between the execution of \%\f3glBegin\fP
and the corresponding execution of \%\f3glEnd\fP.
.SH ASSOCIATED GETS
\%\f3glGet\fP with argument \%\f3GL_READ_BUFFER\fP
.SH SEE ALSO
\%\f3glCopyPixels(3G)\fP,
\%\f3glCopyTexImage1D(3G)\fP,
\%\f3glCopyTexImage2D(3G)\fP,
\%\f3glCopyTexSubImage1D(3G)\fP,
\%\f3glCopyTexSubImage2D(3G)\fP,

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

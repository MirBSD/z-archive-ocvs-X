.SH NAME
.B "glPolygonMode
\- select a polygon rasterization mode

.SH C SPECIFICATION
void \f3glPolygonMode\fP(
GLenum \fIface\fP,
.nf
.ta \w'\f3void \fPglPolygonMode( 'u
	GLenum \fImode\fP )
.fi

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\f2face\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2face\fP
Specifies the polygons that \f2mode\fP applies to.
Must be
\%\f3GL_FRONT\fP for front-facing polygons,
\%\f3GL_BACK\fP for back-facing polygons,
or \%\f3GL_FRONT_AND_BACK\fP for front- and back-facing polygons.
.TP
\f2mode\fP
Specifies how polygons will be rasterized.
Accepted values are
\%\f3GL_POINT\fP,
\%\f3GL_LINE\fP, and
\%\f3GL_FILL\fP.
The initial value is \%\f3GL_FILL\fP for both front- and back-facing polygons.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3glPolygonMode\fP controls the interpretation of polygons for rasterization.
\f2face\fP describes which polygons \f2mode\fP applies to:
front-facing polygons (\%\f3GL_FRONT\fP),
back-facing polygons (\%\f3GL_BACK\fP),
or both (\%\f3GL_FRONT_AND_BACK\fP).
The polygon mode affects only the final rasterization of polygons.
In particular,
a polygon's vertices are lit and
the polygon is clipped and possibly culled before these modes are applied.
.P
Three modes are defined and can be specified in \f2mode\fP:
.TP 14
\%\f3GL_POINT\fP
Polygon vertices that are marked as the start of a boundary edge
are drawn as points.
Point attributes such as
\%\f3GL_POINT_SIZE\fP and
\%\f3GL_POINT_SMOOTH\fP control
the rasterization of the points.
Polygon rasterization attributes other than \%\f3GL_POLYGON_MODE\fP have no effect.
.TP
\%\f3GL_LINE\fP
Boundary edges of the polygon are drawn as line segments.
They are treated as connected line segments for line stippling;
the line stipple counter and pattern are not reset between segments
(see \%\f3glLineStipple\fP).
Line attributes such as
\%\f3GL_LINE_WIDTH\fP and
\%\f3GL_LINE_SMOOTH\fP control
the rasterization of the lines.
Polygon rasterization attributes other than \%\f3GL_POLYGON_MODE\fP have no effect.
.TP
\%\f3GL_FILL\fP
The interior of the polygon is filled.
Polygon attributes such as
\%\f3GL_POLYGON_STIPPLE\fP and
\%\f3GL_POLYGON_SMOOTH\fP control the rasterization of the polygon.
.SH EXAMPLES
To draw a surface with filled back-facing polygons
and outlined front-facing polygons,
call
.Ex 1
glPolygonMode(\%\f3GL_FRONT\fP, \%\f3GL_LINE\fP);
.Ee
.SH NOTES
Vertices are marked as boundary or nonboundary with an edge flag.
Edge flags are generated internally by the GL when it decomposes
polygons; they can be set explicitly using \%\f3glEdgeFlag\fP.
.SH ERRORS
\%\f3GL_INVALID_ENUM\fP is generated if either \f2face\fP or \f2mode\fP is not
an accepted value.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \%\f3glPolygonMode\fP
is executed between the execution of \%\f3glBegin\fP
and the corresponding execution of \%\f3glEnd\fP.
.SH ASSOCIATED GETS
\%\f3glGet\fP with argument \%\f3GL_POLYGON_MODE\fP
.SH SEE ALSO
\%\f3glBegin(3G)\fP,
\%\f3glEdgeFlag(3G)\fP,
\%\f3glLineStipple(3G)\fP,
\%\f3glLineWidth(3G)\fP,

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

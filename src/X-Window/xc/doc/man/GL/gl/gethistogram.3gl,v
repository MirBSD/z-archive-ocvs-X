.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\f2target\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2target\fP
Must be
\%\f3GL_HISTOGRAM\fP.
.TP
\f2reset\fP
If \%\f3GL_TRUE\fP, each component counter that is actually returned
is reset to zero.  (Other counters are unaffected.)
If \%\f3GL_FALSE\fP, none of the counters in the histogram table is modified.
.TP
\f2format\fP
The  of values to be returned in \f2values\fP.
Must be one of
\%\f3GL_RED\fP,
\%\f3GL_GREEN\fP,

\%\f3GL_UNSIGNED_INT_2_10_10_10_REV\fP
are accepted.
.TP
\f2values\fP
A pointer to storage for the returned histogram table.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3glGetHistogram\fP returns the current histogram table as a one-dimensional image
with the same width as the histogram.
No pixel transfer operations are performed on this image, but pixel storage
modes that are applicable to 1D images are honored.
.PP
Color components that are requested in the specified \f2format\fP, but which
are not included in the internal  of the histogram, are returned as
zero.
.bp
The assignments of internal color components to the components
requested by \f2format\fP are:
.TS
center;
lb lb
l l.
_
Internal Component	Resulting Component
_
Red	Red
Green	Green
Blue	Blue
Alpha	Alpha
Luminance	Red
_
.TE

.SH NOTES
\%\f3glGetHistogram\fP is present only if \%\f3GL_ARB_imaging\fP is returned when \%\f3glGetString\fP
is called with an argument of \%\f3GL_EXTENSIONS\fP.
.SH ERRORS
\%\f3GL_INVALID_ENUM\fP is generated if \f2target\fP is not \%\f3GL_HISTOGRAM\fP.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_ENUM\fP is generated if \f2format\fP is not one of the allowable
values.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_ENUM\fP is generated if \f2type\fP is not one of the allowable
values.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \%\f3glGetHistogram\fP is executed
between the execution of \%\f3glBegin\fP and the corresponding
execution of \%\f3glEnd\fP.
.P
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \f2type\fP is one of

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

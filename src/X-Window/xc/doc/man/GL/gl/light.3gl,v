.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3glLight\fP sets the values of individual light source parameters.
\f2light\fP names the light and is a symbolic name of the form \%\f3GL_LIGHT\fP$i$,
where 0 \(<= i < \%\f3GL_MAX_LIGHTS\fP.
\f2pname\fP specifies one of ten light source parameters,
again by symbolic name.
\f2params\fP is either a single value or a pointer to an array that contains
the new values.
.P
To enable and disable lighting calculation, call \%\f3glEnable\fP
and \%\f3glDisable\fP with argument \%\f3GL_LIGHTING\fP. Lighting is
initially disabled.
When it is enabled,
light sources that are enabled contribute to the lighting calculation.
Light source $i$ is enabled and disabled using \%\f3glEnable\fP and
\%\f3glDisable\fP with argument \%\f3GL_LIGHT\fP$i$. 
.P
The ten light parameters are as follows:
.TP 20
\%\f3GL_AMBIENT\fP
\f2params\fP contains four integer or floating-point values that specify
the ambient RGBA intensity of the light.
Integer values are mapped linearly such that the most positive representable
value maps to 1.0,
and the most negative representable value maps to \-1.0.
Floating-point values are mapped directly.
Neither integer nor floating-point values are clamped.
The initial ambient light intensity is (0, 0, 0, 1).
.TP
\%\f3GL_DIFFUSE\fP
\f2params\fP contains four integer or floating-point values that specify
the diffuse RGBA intensity of the light.
Integer values are mapped linearly such that the most positive representable
value maps to 1.0,
and the most negative representable value maps to \-1.0.
Floating-point values are mapped directly.
Neither integer nor floating-point values are clamped.
The initial value
for \%\f3GL_LIGHT0\fP is (1, 1, 1, 1); for other lights, the
initial value is (0, 0, 0, 0). 
.TP
\%\f3GL_SPECULAR\fP
\f2params\fP contains four integer or floating-point values that specify
the specular RGBA intensity of the light.
Integer values are mapped linearly such that the most positive representable
value maps to 1.0,
and the most negative representable value maps to \-1.0.
Floating-point values are mapped directly.
Neither integer nor floating-point values are clamped.
The initial value
for \%\f3GL_LIGHT0\fP is (1, 1, 1, 1); for other lights, the
initial value is (0, 0, 0, 0). 
.TP
\%\f3GL_POSITION\fP
\f2params\fP contains four integer or floating-point values that specify
the position of the light in homogeneous object coordinates.
Both integer and floating-point values are mapped directly.
Neither integer nor floating-point values are clamped.
.IP
The position is transformed by the modelview matrix when
\%\f3glLight\fP is called (just as if it were a point),
and it is stored in eye coordinates.
If the $w$ component of the position is 0,
the light is treated as a directional source.
Diffuse and specular lighting calculations take the light's direction,
but not its actual position,
into account,
and attenuation is disabled.
Otherwise,
diffuse and specular lighting calculations are based on the actual location
of the light in eye coordinates,
and attenuation is enabled.
The initial position is (0, 0, 1, 0);
thus, the initial light source is directional,
parallel to, and in the direction of the $-z$ axis.
.TP
\%\f3GL_SPOT_DIRECTION\fP
\f2params\fP contains three integer or floating-point values that specify
the direction of the light in homogeneous object coordinates.
Both integer and floating-point values are mapped directly.
Neither integer nor floating-point values are clamped.
.IP
The spot direction is transformed by the inverse of the modelview matrix when
\%\f3glLight\fP is called (just as if it were a normal),
and it is stored in eye coordinates.
It is significant only when \%\f3GL_SPOT_CUTOFF\fP is not 180,
which it is initially.
The initial direction is (0, 0, \-1).
.TP
\%\f3GL_SPOT_EXPONENT\fP
\f2params\fP is a single integer or floating-point value that specifies
the intensity distribution of the light.
Integer and floating-point values are mapped directly.
Only values in the range [0,128] are accepted.
.IP
Effective light intensity is attenuated by the cosine of the angle between
the direction of the light and the direction from the light to the vertex
being lighted,
raised to the power of the spot exponent.
Thus, higher spot exponents result in a more focused light source,
regardless of the spot cutoff angle (see \%\f3GL_SPOT_CUTOFF\fP, next paragraph).
The initial spot exponent is 0,
resulting in uniform light distribution.
.TP
\%\f3GL_SPOT_CUTOFF\fP
\f2params\fP is a single integer or floating-point value that specifies
the maximum spread angle of a light source.
Integer and floating-point values are mapped directly.
Only values in the range [0,90] and the special value 180
are accepted.
If the angle between the direction of the light and the direction from the
light to the vertex being lighted is greater than the spot cutoff angle,
the light is completely masked.
.BP
Otherwise, its intensity is controlled by the spot exponent and the
attenuation factors.
The initial spot cutoff is 180,
resulting in uniform light distribution.
.TP
\%\f3GL_CONSTANT_ATTENUATION\fP
.TP
\%\f3GL_LINEAR_ATTENUATION \fP
.TP
\%\f3GL_QUADRATIC_ATTENUATION\fP
\f2params\fP is a single integer or floating-point value that specifies
one of the three light attenuation factors.
Integer and floating-point values are mapped directly.
Only nonnegative values are accepted.
If the light is positional,
rather than directional,
its intensity is attenuated by the reciprocal of the sum of the constant
factor, the linear factor times the distance between the light
and the vertex being lighted,
and the quadratic factor times the square of the same distance.
The initial attenuation factors are (1, 0, 0),
resulting in no attenuation.
.SH NOTES
It is always the case that \%\f3GL_LIGHT\fP$i$ = \%\f3GL_LIGHT0\fP + $i$.
.SH ERRORS
\%\f3GL_INVALID_ENUM\fP is generated if either \f2light\fP or \f2pname\fP
is not an accepted value.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_VALUE\fP is generated if a spot exponent value is specified
outside the range [0,128],
or if spot cutoff is specified outside the range [0,90] (except for the
special value 180),
or if a negative attenuation factor is specified.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \%\f3glLight\fP is executed between
the execution of
\%\f3glBegin\fP and the corresponding execution of \%\f3glEnd\fP.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

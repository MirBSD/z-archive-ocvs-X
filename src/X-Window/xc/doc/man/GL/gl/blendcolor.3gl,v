\f2red\fP, \f2green\fP, \f2blue\fP, \f2alpha\fP
specify the components of \%\f3GL_BLEND_COLOR\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \%\f3GL_BLEND_COLOR\fP may be used to calculate the source and destination
blending factors. The color components are clamped to the range [0,\ 1]
before being stored. See \%\f3glBlendFunc\fP for a complete description of the
blending operations.
Initially the \%\f3GL_BLEND_COLOR\fP is set to (0, 0, 0, 0).
.SH NOTES
\%\f3glBlendColor\fP is part of the \%\f3GL_ARB_imaging\fP subset. \%\f3glBlendColor\fP is present only
if \%\f3GL_ARB_imaging\fP is returned when \%\f3glGetString\fP is called with
\%\f3GL_EXTENSIONS\fP as its argument.
.SH ERRORS
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \%\f3glBlendColor\fP is executed
between the execution of \%\f3glBegin\fP and the corresponding
execution of \%\f3glEnd\fP.
.P

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

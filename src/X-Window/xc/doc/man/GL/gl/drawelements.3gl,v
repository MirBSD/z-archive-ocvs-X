.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\fIindices\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2mode\fP
Specifies what kind of primitives to render.
Symbolic constants
\%\f3GL_POINTS\fP,
\%\f3GL_LINE_STRIP\fP,
\%\f3GL_LINE_LOOP\fP,
\%\f3GL_LINES\fP,
\%\f3GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP\fP,

\%\f3GL_TRIANGLES\fP,
\%\f3GL_QUAD_STRIP\fP,
\%\f3GL_QUADS\fP,
and \%\f3GL_POLYGON\fP are accepted. 
.TP
\f2count\fP
Specifies the number of elements to be rendered.
.TP
\f2type\fP
Specifies the type of the values in \f2indices\fP. Must be one of
\%\f3GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE\fP, \%\f3GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT\fP, or
\%\f3GL_UNSIGNED_INT\fP. 
.TP
\f2indices\fP
Specifies a pointer to the location where the indices are stored. 
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3glDrawElements\fP specifies multiple geometric primitives
with very few subroutine calls. Instead of calling a GL function
to pass each individual vertex, normal, texture coordinate, edge
flag, or color, you can prespecify
separate arrays of vertices, normals, and so on and use them to
construct a sequence of primitives with a single
call to \%\f3glDrawElements\fP.
.P
When \%\f3glDrawElements\fP is called, it uses \f2count\fP sequential elements from an
enabled array, starting at \f2indices\fP to construct a sequence of
geometric primitives. \f2mode\fP specifies what kind of primitives are
constructed, and how the array elements construct these primitives. If
more than one array is enabled, each is used. If
\%\f3GL_VERTEX_ARRAY\fP is not enabled, no geometric primitives are
constructed.
.P
Vertex attributes that are modified by \%\f3glDrawElements\fP have an
unspecified value after \%\f3glDrawElements\fP returns. For example, if
\%\f3GL_COLOR_ARRAY\fP is enabled, the value of the current color is
undefined after \%\f3glDrawElements\fP executes. Attributes that aren't
modified maintain their previous values.
.SH NOTES
\%\f3glDrawElements\fP is available only if the GL version is 1.1 or greater.
.P
\%\f3glDrawElements\fP is included in display lists. If \%\f3glDrawElements\fP is entered into a
display list, 
the necessary array data (determined by the array pointers and
enables) is also 
entered into the display list. Because the array pointers and
enables are client-side state, their values affect display lists
when the lists are created, not when the lists are executed.
.SH ERRORS
\%\f3GL_INVALID_ENUM\fP is generated if \f2mode\fP is not an accepted value.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_VALUE\fP is generated if \f2count\fP is negative.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \%\f3glDrawElements\fP is executed between
the execution of \%\f3glBegin\fP and the corresponding \%\f3glEnd\fP.
.SH SEE ALSO

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

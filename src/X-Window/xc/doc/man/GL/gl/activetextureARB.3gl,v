.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\f2texture\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2texture\fP
Specifies which texture unit to make active. The number
of texture units is implementation dependent, but must be at least
two. \f2texture\fP must be one of \%\f3GL_TEXTURE\fP$i$\f3_ARB\fP, where 
0 \(<= $ i $ < \%\f3GL_MAX_TEXTURE_UNITS_ARB\fP, which is an
implementation-dependent value.  The intial value is \%\f3GL_TEXTURE0_ARB\fP.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3glActiveTextureARB\fP selects which texture unit subsequent texture state calls will
affect.  The number of texture units an implementation supports is
implementation dependent, but must be at least 2.
.P
Vertex arrays are client-side GL resources, which are selected by the 
\%\f3glClientActiveTextureARB\fP routine.
.SH NOTES
\%\f3glActiveTextureARB\fP is only supported if \%\f3GL_ARB_multitexture\fP is included in the
string returned by \%\f3glGetString\fP when called with the argument
\%\f3GL_EXTENSIONS\fP.
.SH ERRORS 
\%\f3GL_INVALID_ENUM\fP is generated if \f2texture\fP is not one of
\%\f3GL_TEXTURE\fP$i$\f3_ARB\fP,
.br
where 0 \(<= $ i $ < \%\f3GL_MAX_TEXTURE_UNITS_ARB\fP.

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@That's what OpenBSD will, probably, ship as XF4 in 3.5
their last sync against XFree86 4.3-current has been
imported into our vendor branch, too

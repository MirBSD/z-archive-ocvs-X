.TP \w'\f2m\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2m\fP
Specifies a pointer to 16 consecutive values, which are used as the
elements of a $4 ~times~ 4$ column-major matrix. 
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3glLoadMatrix\fP replaces the current matrix with the one whose elements are specified by
\f2m\fP.
The current matrix is the projection matrix,
modelview matrix,
or texture matrix,
depending on the current matrix mode
(see \%\f3glMatrixMode\fP).
.P
The current matrix, M, defines a transformation of coordinates.
For instance, assume M refers to the modelview matrix.
If  $v ~=~ (v[0], v[1], v[2], v[3])$ is the set of object coordinates
of a vertex,
and \f2m\fP points to an array of $16$ 
single- or double-precision
floating-point values $m[0], m[1],. . .,m[15]$,
then the modelview transformation $M(v)$ does the following:
.P

{left ( matrix {
ccol { ~v[0]~ above ~v[1]~ above ~v[2]~ above ~v[3]~ }
} right )} }}

.P
Where ``$times$'' denotes matrix multiplication.
.P
Projection and texture transformations are similarly defined.
.SH NOTES
While the elements of the matrix may be specified with
single or double precision, the GL implementation may
store or operate on these values in less than single
precision.
.SH ERRORS
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \%\f3glLoadMatrix\fP
is executed between the execution of \%\f3glBegin\fP
and the corresponding execution of \%\f3glEnd\fP.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.TP
\f2row\fP
Pointer to storage for the row filter image.
.TP
\f2column\fP
Pointer to storage for the column filter image.
.TP
\f2span\fP
Pointer to storage for the span filter image (currently unused).
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3glGetSeparableFilter\fP returns the two one-dimensional filter kernel images for the
current separable 2D convolution filter.
The row image is placed in \f2row\fP and the column image is placed in
\f2column\fP according to the specifications in \f2format\fP and \f2type\fP.
(In the current implementation, \f2span\fP is not affected in any way.)
No pixel transfer operations are performed on the images, but the relevant
pixel storage modes are applied.
.sp
Color components that are present in \f2format\fP but not included in the
internal  of the filters are returned as zero.
The assignments of internal color components to the components of \f2format\fP
are as follows:
.sp

.TS
center;
cb cb
l l.
_
Internal Component	Resulting Component
_
Red	Red
Green	Green
Blue	Blue
Alpha	Alpha
Luminance	Red
Intensity	Red
_
.TE

.SH NOTES
\%\f3glGetSeparableFilter\fP is present only if \%\f3GL_ARB_imaging\fP is returned when \%\f3glGetString\fP
is called with an argument of \%\f3GL_EXTENSIONS\fP.
.P
Non-separable 2D filters must be retrieved with \%\f3glGetConvolutionFilter\fP.
.SH ERRORS
\%\f3GL_INVALID_ENUM\fP is generated if \f2target\fP is not \%\f3GL_SEPARABLE_2D\fP.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_ENUM\fP is generated if \f2format\fP is not one of the allowable
values.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_ENUM\fP is generated if \f2type\fP is not one of the allowable
values.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \%\f3glGetSeparableFilter\fP is executed
between the execution of \%\f3glBegin\fP and the corresponding
execution of \%\f3glEnd\fP.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \f2type\fP is one of
\%\f3GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE_3_3_2\fP,
\%\f3GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE_2_3_3_REV\fP,
\%\f3GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_6_5\fP, or
\%\f3GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_6_5_REV\fP
and \f2format\fP is not \%\f3GL_RGB\fP.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \f2type\fP is one of

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.LP
The SmeLine object is used to add a horizontal line or menu separator to
a menu.  Since each SmeLine is an independent object, the application
is able to change the color, height, and other attributes of the SmeLine
objects on an entry by entry basis.  This object is not selectable, and
will not highlight when the pointer cursor is over it.

Resources
.IN "SmeLine object" "resources"

The resources associated with the SmeLine object are defined in this section,
and affect only the single menu entry specified by this object.

.IP \fBforeground\fP 1.5i
A pixel value which indexes the SimpleMenu's colormap to derive the
foreground color used to draw the separator line.
.Hw
Keep in mind that the SimpleMenu widget will force all menu items to
be the width of the widest entry.  Thus, setting the width is generally not
very important.
.Ix
.IP \fBlineWidth\fP 1.5i
The width of the horizontal line that is to be displayed.
.IP \fBstipple\fP 1.5i
If a bitmap is specified for this resource, the line will be stippled
through it.  This allows the menu separator to be rendered as something
more exciting than just a line.  For instance, if you define a stipple
that is a chain link, then your menu separators will look like chains.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

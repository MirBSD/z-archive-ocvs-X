The AsciiSink or MultiSink object is used by a text widget to render the text.
Depending on its \fBinternational\fP resource, a
AsciiText widget will create one or the other of these when the AsciiText
itself is created.  Both types are nearly identical; the following discussion
applies to both, with MultiSink differences noted only as they occur.
The AsciiSink
will display all printing characters in an 8 bit font, along with handling Tab
and Carriage Return.  The name has been left as ``AsciiSink'' for compatibility.
\fIThe MultiSink will display all printing characters in a font set, along with
handling Tab and Carriage
Return.\fP    The source object also reports the text window metrics to the
text widgets.

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

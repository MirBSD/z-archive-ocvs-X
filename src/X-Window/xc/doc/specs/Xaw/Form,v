.LP
The Form widget can contain an arbitrary number of children or
subwidgets.  The Form provides geometry management for its children,
which allows individual control of the position of each child.  Any
combination of children can be added to a Form.  The initial positions
of the children may be computed relative to the positions of previously
created children.  When the Form is resized, it computes new positions and
sizes for its children.  This computation is based upon information
provided when a child is added to the Form.
.LP
The default width of the Form is the minimum width needed to
enclose the children after computing their initial layout, with a
margin of \fBdefaultDistance\fP
at the right and bottom edges.  If a width and height is assigned
to the Form that is too small for the layout, the children will
be clipped by the right and bottom edges of the Form.

Example
.LP
If you wish to force the Form to never resize one or more of its
children, then set \fBleft\fP and \fBright\fP to \fBXawChainLeft\fP and
\fBtop\fP and \fBbottom\fP to \fBXawChainTop\fP.  This will cause the
child to remain a fixed distance from the top and left edges of the
Form, and never to resize.
.NH 3
Convenience Routines
.LP
To force or defer a re-layout of the Form, use
.PN XawFormDoLayout .
.IN "Form widget" "re-layout"
.IN "XawFormDoLayout" "" "@@DEF@@"
.FD 0
void XawFormDoLayout(\fIw\fP, \fIdo_layout\fP)
.br
     Widget \fIw\fP;
.br
     Boolean \fIdo_layout\fP;
.FN
.IP \fIw\fP 1i
Specifies the Form widget.
.IP \fIdo_layout\fP 1i
Specifies whether the layout of the Form widget is enabled (\fBTrue\fP)
or disabled (\fBFalse\fP).
.LP
When making several changes to the children of a Form widget
after the Form has been realized, it is a good idea to disable
relayout until after all changes have been made.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.LP
The SmeBSB object is used to create a menu entry that contains a string,
and optional bitmaps in its left and right margins.  Since each menu
entry is an independent object, the application is able to change the
font, color, height, and other attributes of the menu entries, on an
entry by entry basis.  The format of the string may either be the encoding
of the 8 bit \fBfont\fP utilized, or in a multi-byte encoding for use with a
\fBfontSet\fP.

.As
.IP \fBcallback\fP 1.5i
All callback functions on this list are called when the SimpleMenu
\fInotifies\fP this entry that the user has selected it.
.Dc
.IP \fBfont\fP 1.5i
The text font to use when displaying the \fBlabel\fP, when the
\fBinternational\fP resource is \fBfalse\fP.
.IP \fBfontSet\fP 1.5i
The text font set to use when displaying the \fBlabel\fP, when the
\fBinternational\fP resource is \fBtrue\fP.
.IP \fBforeground\fP 1.5i
A pixel value which indexes the SimpleMenu's colormap to derive the
foreground color of the menu entry's window.  This color is also 
used to render all 1's in the left and right \fBbitmaps\fP.
.Hw
Keep in mind that the SimpleMenu widget will force the width of all
menu entries to be the width of the longest entry.
.In
.IP \fBjustify\fP 1.5i
How the label is to be rendered between the left and right margins when
the space is wider than the actual text.  This resource may be
specified with the values \fBXtJustifyLeft\fP, \fBXtJustifyCenter\fP,
or \fBXtJustifyRight\fP.  When specifying the justification from a
resource file the values \fBleft\fP, \fBcenter\fP, or \fBright\fP may be
used.
.IP \fBlabel\fP 1.5i
This is a the string that will be displayed in the menu entry.  The
exact location of this string within the bounds of the menu entry is
controlled by the \fBleftMargin\fP, \fBrightMargin\fP, \fBvertSpace\fP,
and \fBjustify\fP resources.
.IP \fBleftBitmap\fP 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP \fBrightBitmap\fP 1.5i
This is a name of a bitmap to display in the left or right margin of the
menu entry.  All 1's in the bitmap will be rendered in the foreground
color, and all 0's will be drawn in the background color of the
SimpleMenu widget.  It is the
programmers' responsibility to make sure that the menu entry is tall
enough, and the appropriate margin wide enough to accept the bitmap.
If care is not taken the bitmap may extend into another menu entry, or
into this entry's label.
.IP \fBleftMargin\fP 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP \fBrightMargin\fP 1.5i
This is the amount of space (in pixels) that will be left between the
edge of the menu entry and the label string.
.Se
.IP \fBvertSpace\fP 1.5i
This is the amount of vertical padding, expressed as a percentage of
the height of the font, that is to be placed around the label of a
menu entry.. The label and bitmaps are always centered vertically
within the menu.  The default value for this
resource (25) causes the default height to be 125% of the height of the
font.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

The Sme object is the base class for all menu entries.  While this
object is mainly intended to be subclassed, it may be used in a menu to
add blank space between menu entries.  
.NH 3
Resources
.IN "SmeLine object" "resources"
.LP
The resources associated with the SmeLine object are defined in this
section, and affect only the single menu entry specified by this object.
There are no new resources added for this class, as it picks up all its
resources from the RectObj class.

Subclassing the Sme Object
.IN "Sme object" "subclassing" "@@DEF"
.LP
.sp
To Create a new Sme object \fIclass\fP you will need to define three class methods.
These methods allow the SimpleMenu to highlight and unhighlight the
menu entry as the pointer cursor moves over it, as well as notify the
entry when the user has selected it.  All of
these methods may be inherited from the Sme object, although the default
semantics are not very interesting.
.IP \fBHighlight\fP(\|) 1i
.IN "Sme object" "Highlight method"
Called to put the menu entry into the highlighted state.
.IP \fBUnhighlight\fP(\|) 1i
.IN "Sme object" "Unhighlight method"
Called to return the widget to its normal (unhighlighted) state.
.IP \fBNotify\fP(\|) 
.IN "Sme object" "Notify method"
Called when the user selects this menu entry.
.LP
.sp
Other then these methods, creating a new object
is straight forward.  Here is some information that may help you
avoid some common mistakes.
.IP 1) 3n
Objects can be zero pixels high.
.IP 2) 3n
Objects draw on their parent's window, therefore the Drawing dimensions
are different from those of widgets.  For instance, y locations vary
from \fBy\fP to \fBy + height\fP, not \fB0\fP to \fBheight\fP.
.IP 3) 3n
XtSetValues calls may come from the application while the Sme is highlighted,
and if the SetValues method returns True, will result in an expose event.
The SimpleMenu may later call the menu entry's \fBunhighlight\fP
procedure.  However, due to the asynchronous nature of
X, the expose event generated by \fBXtSetValues\fP will come \fIafter\fP
this unhighlight.
.IP 4) 3n
Remember that your subclass of the Sme does not own the
window.  Share the space with other menu entries, and refrain
from drawing outside the subclass's own section of the menu.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

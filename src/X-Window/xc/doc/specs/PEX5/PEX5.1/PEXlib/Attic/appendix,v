Appendix A:  PEXlib Programming for both 5.0 and 5.1
.XE
.SH
Introduction
.XS
	Introduction
.XE
.LP
A PEXlib program written to use only functionality specified
in PEX 5.0 will work with a PEX server that supports either
PEX 5.0 or PEX 5.1 protocol.  However, if a PEXlib program
uses functionality present only in PEX 5.1, the program will
likely fail on a PEX 5.0 server.
.LP
This addendum gathers the differences between PEX 5.0 and PEX
5.1 in one place so the programmer can understand and account
for the changes.  The programmer may wish to take advantage
of PEX 5.1 functions, if present, and perform some alternate
action if not.
.SH
Determining the Protocol Version
.XS
	Determining the Protocol Version
.XE
.LP
The first task is for the programmer to determine the protocol
version that the server supports, so the program may behave
accordingly.  This is accomplished with the
.PN PEXGetExtensionInfo
function:
.ID
.Co
int                     status;
PEXExtensionInfo        *pexinfo;
char                    errstr[PEXErrorStringLength];
.
.
.
status = PEXInitialize( display, PEXErrorStringLength, errstr );
if (status != 0) {
    fprintf( stderr, "%s\n", errstr );
    exit(0);
}
pexinfo = PEXGetExtensionInfo( display );

/* The server is a PEX 5.1 server if (pexinfo->major_version == 5) */
/* and (pexinfo->minor_version == 1). */
.ft P
.DE
.SH
Events
.XS
	Events
.XE
.LP
PEX 5.1 defines a new X Event,
.PN PEXMaxHitsReached .
Some 5.1
programs that use
.PN PEXPickAll
may wish to watch for this event to decide
if additional pick passes are necessary.  This event will
not be sent by a PEX 5.0 server.
.SH
Enumerated Type Information
.XS
	Enumerated Type Information
.XE
.LP
.PN PEXETHLHSRMode
- PEX 5.1 defines the new registered value
.PN PEXHLHSRZBufferID
.br
.PN PEXETPickOneMethod
- New enum type for 5.1.
.br
.PN PEXETPickAllMethod
- New enum type for 5.1.
.br
.PN PEXETEscape
- New enum type for 5.1
.LP
Applications should not expect to find the
.PN PEXHLHSRZBufferID
standard
value when querying the HLHSR mode enum type from a 5.0 server
and should therefore not attempt to use it.
Applications should not attempt to query the other three types
from a PEX 5.0 server.
.SH
Implementation Dependent Constants
.XS
	Implementation Dependent Constants
.XE
.LP
.PN PEXIDMaxHitsEventSupported
- New for PEX 5.1
.LP
Applications should not attempt to query this value using the
.PN PEXGetImpDepConstants
function from a PEX 5.0 server.
.SH
General Functions
.XS
	General Functions
.XE
.LP
The following PEXlib functions are new for PEX 5.1 and should
not be sent to a PEX 5.0 server.

.PN PEXEscapeWithReply
.PN PEXSetEchoColor

Output Commands

	Output Commands
.XE
.LP
The

output command function must not be sent to a PEX 5.0 server
or stored in a structure network that will be rendered by a
PEX 5.0 server.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

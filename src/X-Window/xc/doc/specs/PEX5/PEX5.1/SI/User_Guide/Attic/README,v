			PEX-SI User Guide

This document will help you get started with the PEX-SI.  It includes
an overview of the menu hierarchy and a description of each of the 
documents delivered with PEX-SI.  It also provides instruction on using
the various PEX-SI programs and clients.

This directory contains the PostScript files you need to print the User Guide.  

	cover.ps -- The cover sheet
	contents.ps -- The table of contents
	tables.ps -- The list of tables
	figures.ps -- The list of figures
	doc.ps -- The chapter and appendix body pages.
	index.ps -- The index

On most systems you can use lpr to print the files.  You should print in the 
order listed above so you do not have to collate.  The document is designed 
to be double sided, and each part of the document (i.e. table of contents, 
tables and figures listings, chapters and index) begins on an odd page number.  
You may have to supply some blank pages before copying.

This directory also contains the document troff source files. The document 
consists of 5 files:

	cover.ug -- The cover sheet
	user_guide -- All of the User Guide chapters
	server_app.ug -- The server functional description
	archive_app.ug -- The archive file information

In addition, this directory contains this README and a Makefile.  The targets
included in the Makefile are:

	all --	Troffs all document files into dit (device independent troff) files.
		It also creates an index, table of contents, and table and figure 
		listings.  The resultant files are cover.dit, contents.dit 
		(table of contents), tables.dit, figures.dit, doc.dit (all chapters), 
		and index.dit. 

		Note: You will have to provide your own mechanism for converting
		the files to PostScript files if you are going to use the Makefile. 

	clean -- If you modify the text in anyway and want to `re-make' the
		document, you should first do a ``make clean'' before doing a 
		``make all''.  This target will remove all dit files, the 
		slush.file and the outline file created in the previous make.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the
#       C Language, BSD/Berkeley Unix; 386BSD, NetBSD 1.1 and OpenBSD.
#
# Anyone who obtained a copy of this work is hereby permitted to freely use,
# distribute, modify, merge, sublicence, give away or sell it as long as the
# authors are given due credit and the following notice is retained:
#
# This work is provided "as is", with no explicit or implicit warranty what-
# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-
# butor be held liable for any damage, directly or indirectly, that origina-
# ted through or is caused by creation or modification of this work.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.H C "Introduction
.LP
This document is an extension of the \fI\s-1PEX-SI\s+1 Architecture Specification\fR.
It provides implementation specific information that will help you to 
port and customize the \s-1PEX-SI\s+1.
.LP
.H 2 "Expected Audience"
.LP
The target audiences for this document are the \fICustomizer\fR and the \fIPorter\fR.
This document will also provide assistance to users compiling on non-BSD platforms.
The Customizer and Porter audience types are defined for \s-1PEX-SI\s+1 as follows:
.LP
.nf
.ta 1.5i +1.5i
\fICustomizer\fR
.IX "User Types" "Customizer"
.RS
This person is interested in easy modifications of \s-1PEX-SI\s+1.
This may include changing implementation dependent capabilities and
parameters but does not involve changing code.
This person should read the \fIUser Guide\fR and the sections 
on customization in this document.
.RE
.LP
\fIPorter\fR
.IX "User Types" "Porter"
.RS
This person is interested in porting the \s-1SI\s+1 to specific software
and/or hardware.
This includes changing and optimizing the code for specific devices.
This person should read the \fIArchitecture Specification\fR 
and this document.
.RE
.H 2 "General Porting Concerns"
.BP
System V systems may have a problem compiling \s-1PEX-SI\s+1 because of possible
circular include references.
.H 2 "Compile Options" 
.LP
The compile options available for the \s-1PEX-ME\s+1 are the following:
.LP
.IP "\s-1PEXEXT\s+1" 28
(\s-1PEX-SI\s+1) Enables the \s-1PEX-ME\s+1.  Must be defined for
the \s-1PEX-SI\s+1 to function.
.IP "\s-1DDTEST\s+1" 28
(\s-1PEX-ME\s+1) Prints debugging and state information.
in \s-1\fL.../extensions/server/PEX/dipex/util\fR\s+1 to print debugging information.
.IP "\s-1PEX_DEFAULT_FONTPATH\s+1" 28
(\s-1PEX-ME\s+1) Defines the default path to \s-1PEX\s+1 fonts.
.IP "\s-1NDEBUG\s+1" 28
(\s-1PEX-API\s+1) Disables extra debugging code and messages.
.IP "\s-1PEX_API_SOCKET_IPC\s+1" 28
(\s-1PEX-API\s+1) Uses Unix sockets instead of System V shared memory.
.H 3 "Changing Implementation Dependent Parameters"
.LP
See the files \fL\s-1.../ddPEX/mi/include/miInfo.h\fR\s+1 
and \fL\s-1.../ddpex/mi/shared/miMisc.c\fR\s+1.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the
#       C Language, BSD/Berkeley Unix; 386BSD, NetBSD 1.1 and OpenBSD.
#
# Anyone who obtained a copy of this work is hereby permitted to freely use,
# distribute, modify, merge, sublicence, give away or sell it as long as the
# authors are given due credit and the following notice is retained:
#
# This work is provided "as is", with no explicit or implicit warranty what-
# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-
# butor be held liable for any damage, directly or indirectly, that origina-
# ted through or is caused by creation or modification of this work.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

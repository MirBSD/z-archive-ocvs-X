Chapter 8 \(em Callbacks
.XE
.IN "Destroy Callbacks"
Applications and other widgets often need to register a procedure
with a widget that gets called under certain prespecified conditions.
For example,
when a widget is destroyed,
every procedure on the widget's \fIdestroy_callbacks\fP
list is called to notify clients of the widget's impending doom.
.LP
Every widget has an XtNdestroyCallbacks callback list resource.
Widgets can define additional callback lists as they see fit.
For example, the Pushbutton widget has a callback
list to notify clients when the button has been activated.
.LP
Except where otherwise noted, it is the intent that all Intrinsics
functions may be called at any time, including from within callback
procedures, action routines, and event handlers.

.br

.br
      XtPointer \fIcall_data\fP;
.FN
.IP \fIw\fP 1i
Specifies the widget owning the list in which the callback is registered.
.IP \fIclient_data\fP 1i
Specifies additional data supplied by the client when the procedure
was registered.
.IP \fIcall_data\fP 1i
Specifies any callback-specific data the widget wants to pass to the client.
For example,  when Scrollbar executes its XtNthumbChanged callback list,
it passes the new position of the thumb.
.LP
.eM
The \fIclient_data\fP argument provides a way for the
client registering the callback procedure also to register client-specific data,
for example, a pointer to additional information about the widget, 
a reason for invoking the callback, and so on.
The \fIclient_data\fP value may be NULL
if all necessary information is in the widget.
The \fIcall_data\fP argument is a convenience to avoid having simple
cases where the client could otherwise always call
.PN XtGetValues
or a widget-specific function to retrieve data from the widget.
Widgets should generally avoid putting complex state information 
in \fIcall_data\fP.
The client can use the more general data retrieval methods, if necessary.
.LP
Whenever a client wants to pass a callback list as an argument in an
.PN XtCreateWidget ,
.PN XtSetValues ,
or
.PN XtGetValues
call, it should specify the address
of a NULL-terminated array of type
.PN XtCallbackList .

For example, the callback list for procedures A and B with client data
clientDataA and clientDataB, respectively, is

.KS

.ta .5i 3i
static XtCallbackRec callbacks[] = {
	{A, (XtPointer) clientDataA},
	{B, (XtPointer) clientDataB},
	{(XtCallbackProc) NULL, (XtPointer) NULL}
};
.De
.KE
.LP
Although callback lists are passed by address in arglists
and varargs lists,
the \*(xI recognize callback lists
through the widget resource list and will copy the contents
when necessary.
Widget initialize and set_values procedures
should not allocate memory for the callback list contents.
The \*(xI automatically do this,
potentially using a different structure for their
internal representation.

.NH 2
Identifying Callback Lists
.XS
\fB\*(SN Identifying Callback Lists\fP
.XE
.LP
Whenever a widget contains a callback list for use by clients, 
it also exports in its public .h file the resource name of the callback list.
Applications and client widgets never access callback list fields directly.
Instead, they always identify the desired callback list by using the exported
resource name.
All the callback manipulation functions described in this chapter 
except
.PN XtCallCallbackList
check 
to see that the requested callback list is indeed implemented by the widget.
.LP
For the \*(xI to find and correctly handle callback lists,
they must be declared with a resource type of
.PN XtRCallback .
The internal representation of a callback list is
implementation-dependent; widgets may make no assumptions about the
value stored in this resource if it is non-NULL.  Except to compare
the value to NULL (which is equivalent to
.PN XtCallbackStatus
.PN XtCallbackHasNone ),
access to callback list resources must be made
through other \*(xI procedures.

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

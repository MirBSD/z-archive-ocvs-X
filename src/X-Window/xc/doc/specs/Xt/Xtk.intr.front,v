The design of the X11 Intrinsics was done primarily 
by Joel McCormack of Digital WSL. 
Major contributions to the design and implementation also
were done by Charles Haynes, Mike Chow, and Paul Asente of Digital WSL.
Additional contributors to the design and/or implementation were:

Loretta Guarino-Reid (Digital WSL)	Rich Hyde (Digital WSL)
Susan Angebranndt (Digital WSL)	Terry Weissman (Digital WSL)

Ralph Swick (Project Athena and Digital ERP)	Mark Ackerman (Project Athena)
Ron Newman (Project Athena)	Bob Scheifler (MIT LCS)

The contributors to the X10 toolkit also deserve mention.
Although the X11 Intrinsics present an entirely different programming style, 
they borrow heavily from the implicit and explicit concepts in the X10 
toolkit.
.LP
The design and implementation of the X10 Intrinsics were done by:
.LP
.Ds
Terry Weissman (Digital WSL)
Smokey Wallace (Digital WSL)
Phil Karlton (Digital WSL)
Charles Haynes (Digital WSL)
Frank Hall (HP)

.LP
The design and implementation of the X10 toolkit's sample widgets were 
by the above, as well as by:
.LP
.Ds
Ram Rao (Digital UEG)
Mary Larson (Digital UEG)
Mike Gancarz (Digital UEG)
Kathleen Langone  (Digital UEG)
.De
These widgets provided a checklist of requirements that we
had to address in the X11 Intrinsics.
.LP
Thanks go to Al Mento of Digital's UEG Documentation Group for 
formatting and generally improving this document
and to John Ousterhout of Berkeley for extensively reviewing 
early drafts of it.
.LP
Finally, a special thanks to Mike Chow,
whose extensive performance analysis of the X10 toolkit provided
the justification to redesign it entirely for X11.

The current design of the \*(xI has benefited greatly from the
input of several dedicated reviewers in the membership of the
X Consortium.
In addition to those already mentioned,
the following individuals have dedicated significant time
to suggesting improvements to the \*(xI:

From Release 3 to Release 4, several new members joined the design
team.  We greatly appreciate the thoughtful comments, suggestions,
lengthy discussions, and in some cases implementation code contributed by each
of the following:

In Release 5, the effort to define the internationalization additions was
headed by Bill McMahon of Hewlett Packard and Frank Rojas of IBM.  This
has been an educational process for many of us, and Bill and Frank's
tutelage has carried us through.  Vania Joloboff of the OSF also contributed
to the internationalization additions.  The implementation efforts of
Bill, Gabe Beged-Dov, and especially Donna Converse for this release
are also gratefully acknowledged.

The Release 6 Intrinsics is a result of the collaborative
efforts of participants in the X Consortium's \fBintrinsics\fP
working group.  
A few individuals contributed substantial design proposals,
participated in lengthy discussions, reviewed final specifications,
and in most cases, were also responsible for sections of the implementation.
They deserve recognition and thanks for their major contributions:

Bob Scheifler (X Consortium)	Ajay Vohra (SunSoft)

Many others analyzed designs, offered useful comments and suggestions,
and participated in a significant subset of the process.
The following people deserve thanks for their contributions:
Andy Bovingdon, Sam Chang, Chris Craig,
George Erwin-Grotsky, Keith Edwards, Clive Feather, Stephen Gildea,
Dan Heller, Steve Humphrey, David Kaelbling,
Jaime Lau, Rob Lembree, Stuart Marks, Beth Mynatt,
Tom Paquin, Chris Peterson, Kamesh Ramakrishna, Tom Rodriguez,
Jim VanGilder, Will Walker, and Mike Wexler.
.LP
I am especially grateful to two of my colleagues: Ralph Swick for
expert editorial guidance, and Kaleb Keithley for leadership in
the implementation and the specification work.

\s+1\fBAbout This Manual\fP\s-1
.sp 2
.na
.LP
\fI\*(xT\fP is intended to be read by both application programmers who will
use one or more of the many widget sets built with the \*(xI 
and by widget programmers who will use the \*(xI to build widgets 
for one of the widget sets.
Not all the information in this manual, however, applies to both audiences.
That is, because the application programmer is likely to use only a number of
the \*(xI functions in writing an application and because the widget programmer
is likely to use many more, if not all, of the \*(xI functions in building 
a widget,
an attempt has been made to highlight those areas of information that are
deemed to be of special interest for the application programmer.
(It is assumed the widget programmer will have to be familiar with all 
the information.)
Therefore, all entries in the table of contents that are printed in \fBbold\fP 
indicate the information that should be of special interest to an 
application programmer.
.LP
It is also assumed that, as application programmers become
more familiar with the concepts discussed in this manual,
they will find it more convenient to implement
portions of their applications as special-purpose or custom widgets.
It is possible, nonetheless, to use widgets without knowing how to build them.
.SH
Conventions Used in this Manual
.LP
This document uses the following conventions:
.IP \(bu 5
Global symbols are printed in
.PN this
.PN special
.PN font .
These can be either function names,
symbols defined in include files, data types, or structure names.
Arguments to functions, procedures, or macros are printed in \fIitalics\fP.
.IP \(bu 5
Each function is introduced by a general discussion that
distinguishes it from other functions.
The function declaration itself follows,
and each argument is specifically explained.
General discussion of the function, if any is required,
follows the arguments.
.IP \(bu 5
To eliminate any ambiguity between those arguments that you pass and those that
a function returns to you,
the explanations for all arguments that you pass start with the word
\fIspecifies\fP or, in the case of multiple arguments, the word \fIspecify\fP.
The explanations for all arguments that are returned to you start with the
word \fIreturns\fP or, in the case of multiple arguments, the word \fIreturn\^\fP.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

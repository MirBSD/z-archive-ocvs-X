\fBAppendix A \(em Resource File Format\fP
.XE
A resource file contains text representing the default resource values for an
application or set of applications.
.LP
The format of resource files is defined by \fI\*(xL\fP and is reproduced here
for convenience only. 
.LP
The format of a resource specification is
.TS
l l .
ResourceLine	= Comment | IncludeFile | ResourceSpec | <empty line>
Comment	= ``!'' {<any character except null or newline>}
IncludeFile	= ``#'' WhiteSpace ``include'' WhiteSpace FileName WhiteSpace
FileName	= <valid filename for operating system>
ResourceSpec	= WhiteSpace ResourceName WhiteSpace ``:'' WhiteSpace Value
ResourceName	= [Binding] {Component Binding} ComponentName
Binding	= ``.'' | ``*''
WhiteSpace	= {<space> | <horizontal tab>}
Component	= ``?'' | ComponentName
ComponentName	= NameChar {NameChar}
NameChar	= ``a''-``z'' | ``A''-``Z'' | ``0''-``9'' | ``_'' | ``-''
Value	= {<any character except null or unescaped newline>}
.TE
.LP
Elements separated by vertical bar (|) are alternatives.
Curly braces ({\&.\&.\&.}) indicate zero or more repetitions
of the enclosed elements.
Square brackets ([\&.\&.\&.]) indicate that the enclosed element is optional.
Quotes (``\&.\&.\&.'') are used around literal characters.
.LP
If the last character on a line is a backslash (\\),
that line is assumed to continue on the next line.
.LP
To allow a Value to begin with whitespace,
the two-character sequence ``\\\^\fIspace\fP'' (backslash followed by space)
is recognized and replaced by a space character,
and the two-character sequence ``\\\^\fItab\fP''
(backslash followed by horizontal tab)
is recognized and replaced by a horizontal tab character.

To allow a Value to contain embedded newline characters,
the two-character sequence ``\\\^n'' is recognized and replaced by a
newline character.
To allow a Value to be broken across multiple lines in a text file,
the two-character sequence ``\\\^\fInewline\fP''
(backslash followed by newline) is
recognized and removed from the value.

To allow a Value to contain arbitrary character codes,
the four-character sequence ``\\\^\fInnn\fP'',
where each \fIn\fP is a digit character in the range of ``0''\-``7'',
is recognized and replaced with a single byte that contains
the octal value specified by the sequence.
Finally, the two-character sequence ``\\\\'' is recognized
and replaced with a single backslash.

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

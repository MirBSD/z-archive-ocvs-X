Overview
.LP
When an X client connects to an X server, it receives a fixed range of
resource IDs to use to identify the client's resources inside the X
server.  Xlib hands these out sequentially as needed.  When it
overruns the end of the range, an IDChoice protocol error results.
Long running clients, or clients that use resource IDs at a rapid
rate, may encounter this circumstance.  When it happens, there are
usually many resource IDs available, but Xlib doesn't know about them.
.LP
One approach to solving this problem would be to have Xlib notice when
a resource is freed and recycle its ID for future use.  This strategy
runs into difficulties because sometimes freeing one resource causes
others to be freed (for example, when a window is destroyed, so are
its children).  To do a complete job, Xlib would have to maintain a
large amount of state that currently resides only in the server (the
entire window tree in the above example).  Even if a less
comprehensive strategy was adopted, such as recycling only those IDs
that Xlib can identify without maintaining additional state, the
additional bookkeeping at resource creation and destruction time
would likely introduce unacceptable overhead.
.LP
To avoid the problems listed above, the server's complete knowledge of
all resource IDs in use by a client is leveraged.  This extension
provides two ways for Xlib to query the server for available resource
IDs.
Xlib can use these extension requests behind the scenes when it has
exhausted its current pool of resource IDs.

Requests
.LP
.PN "XCMiscGetVersion"
.IP
\fIclient_major_version\fP\^: CARD16
.br
\fIclient_minor_version\fP\^: CARD16
.LP
   =>
.IP
\fIserver_major_version\fP\^: CARD16
.br
\fIserver_minor_version\fP\^: CARD16
.LP
If supplied, the \fIclient_major_version\fP and
\fIclient_minor_version\fP indicate what version of the protocol the
client wants the server to implement.  The server version numbers
returned indicate the protocol this extension actually supports.  This
might not equal the version sent by the client.  An implementation can
(but need not) support more than one version simultaneously.  The
\fIserver_major_version\fP and the \fIserver_minor_version\fP are a
mechanism to support future revisions of the XC-MISC protocol
which may be necessary.  In general, the major version would increment
for incompatible changes, and the minor version would increment for
small, upward-compatible changes.  Servers that support the protocol
defined in this document will return a \fIserver_major_version\fP of
one (1), and a \fIserver_minor_version\fP of one (1).
.LP
.PN "XCMiscGetXIDRange"
.LP
   =>
.IP
\fIstart_id\fP\^: XID
.br
\fIcount\fP\^: CARD32
.LP
This request returns a range of available resource IDs for the client
issuing the request.  \fIstart_id\fP is the first ID in the range.
\fIcount\fP is the number of IDs in the range.  The returned range may
or may not be the largest possible range.
.LP
.PN "XCMiscGetXIDList"
.IP
\fIcount\fP\^: CARD32
.LP
   =>
.IP
\fIids\fP\^: LISTofXID
.LP
This request returns the a list of individual resource IDs in \fIids\fP.
\fIcount\fP is the number of resource IDs requested.
The number returned may be smaller than the number requested.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

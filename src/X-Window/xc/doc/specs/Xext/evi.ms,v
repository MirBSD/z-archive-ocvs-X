Introduction
.LP
EVI (Extended Visual Information extension) allows a client to determine
information about core X visuals beyond what the core protocol provides.
.NH 1
Goals
.LP
As the X Window System has evolved, it has become clear that the information
returned by the core X protocol regarding Visuals is often insufficient for a
client to determine which is the most appropriate visual for its needs. This
extension allows clients to query the X server for additional visual
information, specifically as regards colormaps and framebuffer levels.
.LP
This extension is meant to address the needs of pure X clients only. It is
specifically and purposefully not designed to address the needs of X
extensions. Extensions that have an impact on visual information should provide
their own mechanisms for delivering that information. For example, the Double
Buffering Extension (DBE) provides its own mechanism for determining which
visuals support double-buffering.

If supplied, the client_major_version and client_minor_version indicate
what version of the protocol the client wants the server to implement.
The server version numbers returned indicate the protocol this extension
actually supports. This might not equal the version sent by the client.
An implementation can (but need not) support more than one version
simultaneously. The server_major_version and the server_minor_version
are a mechanism to support future revisions of the EVI protocol that
may be necessary. In general, the major version would increment for
incompatible changes, and the minor version would increment for small
upward-compatible changes. Servers that support the protocol defined in
this document will return a server_major_version of one (1), and a
server_minor_version of zero (0).

C Language Binding
.LP
The C functions provide direct access to the protocol and add no additional
semantics.  For complete details on the effects of these functions, refer
to the appropriate protocol request, which can be derived by deleting Xevi
at the start of the function. All functions that have return type Status
will return nonzero for success and zero for failure.
.LP
The include file for this extension is:
.Pn < X11/extensions/XEVI.h >.

.FD 0
.PN Bool XeviQueryVersion(
.br

.FN
.LP
.eM
.IP \fIdisplay\fP 1i
Specifies the connection to the X server.
.IP \fImajor_version_return\fP 1i
Returns the major version supported by the server.
.IP \fIminor_version_return\fP 1i
Returns the minor version supported by the server.
.LP
XeviQueryVersion sets major_version_return and minor_version_return to
the major and minor EVI protocol version supported by the server.  If
the EVI library is compatible with the version returned by the server,
it returns nonzero.  If dpy does not support the EVI extension, or if
there was an error during communication with the server, or if the server
and library protocol versions are incompatible, it returns zero.  No other
Xevi functions may be called before this function. If a client violates
this rule, the effects of all subsequent Xevi calls that it makes are
undefined.
.LP
To get the extended information for any subset of visuals use 
XeviGetVisualInfo.

.FN
.LP
.eM
.IP \fIdisplay\fP 1i
Specifies the connection to the X server.
.IP \fIvisual\fP 1i
If NULL, then information for all visuals of all 
screens is returned. Otherwise, a pointer to a list of visuals for which
extended visual information is desired.
.IP \fIn_visual\fP 1i
If 0, then information for all visuals of all screens is returned. Otherwise,
the number of elements in the array \fIvisual\fP.
.IP \fIevi_return\fP 1i
Returns a pointer to a list of \fIExtendedVisualInfo\fP. When done, the client
should free the list using \fIXFree\fP.
.IP \fIn_info_return\fP 1i
Returns the number of elements in the list of \fIExtendedVisualInfo\fP.
.LP
XeviGetVisualInfo returns a list of ExtendedVisualInfo structures that describe
visual information beyond that supported by the core protocol. This includes 
layer information relevant for systems supporting overlays and/or underlay
planes, and information that allows applications better to determine the level
of hardware support for multiple colormaps. XeviGetVisualInfo returns Success if
successful, or an X error otherwise.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

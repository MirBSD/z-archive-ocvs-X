.TH XLOAD 1 __xorgversion__
.SH NAME
xload \- system load average display for X
.SH SYNOPSIS
.ta 6n
\fBxload\fP	[-\fItoolkitoption\fP ...] [-scale \fIinteger\fP] [-update \fIseconds\fP] [-hl \fIcolor\fP] [-highlight \fIcolor\fP]  [-remote \fIhost\fP]
.br
	[-jumpscroll \fIpixels\fP] [-label \fIstring\fP] [-nolabel] [-lights]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.I xload 
program displays a periodically updating histogram of the system load average.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.I Xload
accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command line options (see \fIX(__miscmansuffix__)\fP).
The order of the options in unimportant.  \fIxload also accepts the
following additional options:
.PP
.TP 8
.B \-hl \fIcolor\fP or \-highlight \fIcolor\fP
This option specifies the color of the scale lines.  
.TP 8
.B \-jumpscroll \fPnumber of pixels\fP
The number of pixels to shift the graph to the left when the graph
reaches the right edge of the window.  The default value is 1/2 the width
of the current window.  Smooth scrolling can be achieved by setting it to 1.
.TP 8
.B \-label \fIstring\fP
The string to put into the label above the load average.
.TP 8
.B \-nolabel
If this command line option is specified then no label will be
displayed above the load graph.
.TP 8
.B \-lights
When specified, this option causes
.I xload
to display the current load average by using the keyboard leds; for
a load average of \fIn\fP, xload lights the first \fIn\fP keyboard leds.
This option turns off the usual screen display.
.TP 8
.B \-scale \fIinteger\fP
This option specifies the minimum number of tick marks in the histogram,
where one division represents one load average point.  If the load goes
above this number, \fIxload\fP will create more divisions, but it will never
use fewer than this number.  The default is 1.
.PP
.TP 8
.B \-update \fIseconds\fP
This option specifies the interval in seconds at which \fIxload\fP
updates its display.  The minimum amount of time allowed between updates
is 1 second.  The default is 10.
.TP 8
.B \-remote \fIhost\fP
This option tells \fIxload\fP to display the load of \fIhost\fP instead of \fIlocalhost\fP. \fIXload\fP gets the information from the \fIrwhod\fP database and consequently requires \fIrwhod\fP to be executing both on \fIlocalhost\fP and \fIhost\fP.
.SH RESOURCES
In addition to the resources available to each of the widgets used by 
\fIxload\fP there is one resource defined by the application itself.
.TP 8
.B showLabel (\fPclass\fB Boolean)
If False then no label will be displayed.
.SH WIDGETS
In order to specify resources, it is useful to know the hierarchy of
the widgets which compose \fIxload\fR.  In the notation below,
indentation indicates hierarchical structure.  The widget class name
is given first, followed by the widget instance name.
.sp
.nf
.ta .5i 1.0i 1.5i 2.0i
XLoad  xload
	Paned  paned
		Label  label
		StripChart  load
.fi
.sp
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
.TP 8
.B DISPLAY
to get the default host and display number.
.TP 8
.B XENVIRONMENT
to get the name of a resource file that overrides the global resources
stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
.SH FILES
<XRoot>/lib/X11/app-defaults/XLoad - specifies required resources
.SH SEE ALSO
X(__miscmansuffix__), xrdb(1), mem(4), Athena StripChart Widget.
.SH BUGS
This program requires the ability to open and read the special system
file \fI/dev/kmem\fP.  Sites that do not allow general access to this file
should make \fIxload\fP belong to the same group as \fI/dev/kmem\fP and
turn on the \fIset group id\fP permission flag.
.PP
Reading /dev/kmem is inherently non-portable.  Therefore, the routine
used to read it (get_load.c) must be ported to each new operating system.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.TH XFD 1 __xorgversion__
.SH NAME
xfd \- display all the characters in an X font
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xfd
[\-options ...] \fB\-fn\fP \fIfontname\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIxfd\fP utility creates a window containing the name of the font being
displayed, a row of command buttons, several lines of text for displaying
character metrics, and a grid containing one glyph per cell.  The
characters are shown in increasing order from left to right, top to
bottom.  The first character displayed at the top left will be character
number 0 unless the \fB\-start\fP option has been supplied in which case the
character with the number given in the \fB\-start\fP option will be used.
.PP
The characters are displayed in a grid of boxes, each large enough to hold 
any single character in the font.  Each character glyph is drawn using
the PolyText16 request (used by the \fIXlib\fP routine \fBXDrawString16\fP).
If the \fB\-box\fP option is given, a rectangle will be drawn around each
character, showing where an ImageText16 request (used by the \fIXlib\fP
routine \fBXDrawImageString16\fP) would cause background color to be displayed.
.PP
The origin of each glyph is normally set so that the character is drawn in
the upper left hand corner of the grid cell.  However, if a glyph has a 
negative left bearing or an unusually large ascent, descent, or right bearing 
(as is the case with \fIcursor\fP font), some character may not appear in their
own grid cells.  The \fB\-center\fP option may be used to force all glyphs to 
be centered in their respective cells.
.PP
All the characters in the font may not fit in the window at once.
To see the next page of glyphs, press the \fINext\fP button at the top 
of the window.  To see the previous page, press \fIPrev\fP.  To exit \fIxfd\fP,
press \fIQuit\fP.
.PP
Individual character metrics (index, width, bearings, ascent and descent) can
be displayed at the top of the window by clicking on the desired character.
.PP
The font name displayed at the top of the window is the full name of the 
font, as determined by the server.  See \fIxlsfonts\fP for ways to generate
lists of fonts, as well as more detailed summaries of their metrics and
properties.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
.I xfd
accepts all of the standard toolkit command line options along with
the additional options listed below:
.TP 8
.B \-fn \fIfont\fP
This option specifies the font to be displayed.  This can also be set with
the FontGrid \fBfont\fP resource.  A font must be specified.
.TP 8
.B \-box
This option indicates that a box should be displayed outlining the area
that would be filled with background color by an ImageText request.
This can also be set with
the FontGrid \fBboxChars\fP resource.  The default is False.
.TP 8
.B \-center
This option indicates that each glyph should be centered in its grid.
This can also be set with
the FontGrid \fBcenterChars\fP resource.  The default is False.
.TP 8
.B \-start \fInumber\fP
This option specifies the glyph index of the upper left hand corner of the
grid.  This is used to view characters at arbitrary locations in the font.
This can also be set with
the FontGrid \fBstartChar\fP resource.  The default is 0.
.TP 8
.B \-bc \fIcolor\fP
This option specifies the color to be used if ImageText boxes are drawn.
This can also be set with
the FontGrid \fBboxColor\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B \-rows \fInumrows\fP
This option specifies the number of rows in the grid.
This can also be set with
the FontGrid \fBcellRows\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B \-columns \fInumcols\fP
This option specifies the number of columns in the grid.
This can also be set with
the FontGrid \fBcellColumns\fP resource.
.SH WIDGETS
In order to specify resources, it is useful to know the 
widgets which compose \fIxfd\fR.  In the notation below, indentation
indicates hierarchical structure.  The widget class name is given first,
followed by the widget instance name.
The application class name is Xfd.

.ta .5i 1.0i 1.5i 2.0i 2.5i 3.0i 3.5i 4.0i 4.5i 5.0i 5.5i 6.0i 6.5i 7.0i

			Command  prev
			Command  next
		Label  select
		Label  metrics
		Label  range
		Label  start
		Form  form
			FontGrid  grid
.fi
.SH FONTGRID RESOURCES
The FontGrid widget is an application-specific widget, and a subclass
of the Simple widget in the Athena widget set.  The effects and
instance names of this widget's resources are given in the
\fBOPTIONS\fP section.  Capitalize the first letter of the resource
instance name to get the corresponding class name.
.SH APPLICATION SPECIFIC RESOURCES
The instance names of the application specific resources
are given below.  Capitalize the first letter of the resource
instance name to get the corresponding class name.
These resources are unlikely to be interesting unless you are localizing
xfd for a different language.
.TP 8
.B selectFormat
Specifies a printf-style format string used to display information
about the selected character.  The default is "character 0x%02x%02x
(%u,%u) (%#o,%#o)".  The arguments that will come after the format string are
char.byte1, char.byte2, char.byte1, char.byte2, char.byte1, char.byte2.
char.byte1 is byte 1 of the selected character.  
char.byte2 is byte 2 of the selected character.  
.TP 8
.B metricsFormat
Specifies a printf-style format string used to display character
metrics.  The default is "width %d; left %d, right %d; ascent %d,
descent %d (font %d, %d)".  The arguments that will come after the
format string are the character metrics width, lbearing, rbearing,
character ascent, character descent, font ascent, and font descent.
.TP 8
.B rangeFormat
Specifies a printf-style format string used to display the range of
characters currently being displayed.  The default is "range:
0x%02x%02x (%u,%u) thru 0x%02x%02x (%u,%u)".  The arguments that will
come after the format string are the following fields from the
XFontStruct that is returned from opening the font:
min_byte1, min_char_or_byte2, min_byte1, min_char_or_byte2,
max_byte1, max_char_or_byte2, max_byte1, max_char_or_byte2.
.TP 8
.B startFormat
Specifies a printf-style format string used to display information
about the character at the upper left corner of the font grid.  The
default is "upper left: 0x%04x (%d,%d)".  The arguments that will come
after the format string are the new character, the high byte of the new
character, and the low byte of the new character.
.TP 8
.B nocharFormat
Specifies a printf-style format string to display when the selected
character does not exist.  The default is "no such character
0x%02x%02x (%u,%u) (%#o,%#o)".  The arguments that will come after the
format string are the same as for the \fBselectFormat\fP resource.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.TH MKCFM 1 "Release 1.0" "CID Fonts Version 1.0"
.SH NAME
mkcfm - create summaries of font metric files in CID font directories
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "mkcfm"
[\fICID-font-directory-name\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
There is usually only one CID font directory on the X font path. It is
usually called \fI/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/CID\fP. If you do not specify
an argument, \fImkcfm\fP will try to go through the subdirectories of
that directory, and create one summary of font metric files for each
CIDFont (character descriptions) file and each CMap (Character Maps) file
it finds. The summaries of font metric files are put in the existing CFM
subdirectory. The CFM subdirectories are created when CID-keyed fonts
are installed.
.PP
If you specify a CID font directory as an argument, \fImkcfm\fP will try
to go through the subdirectories of that directory, and create one summary
of font metric files for each CIDFont file and each CMap file it finds.
.I mkcfm
will calculate the summaries of the font metric files stored in AFM 
subdirectories of the CID font directory.
.PP
Those summaries are needed by the rasterizer of CID-keyed fonts to
speed up the response to X font calls. If those files do not exist, CID
rasterizer will have to go through usually large font metric files, and
calculate the summaries itself each time the font is called. You will
notice a substantial wait on a call to a large CID-keyed font.
.SH FILES
.TP 15
.B .afm files
Each CID-keyed font file is supposed to have a font metric file
(.afm file). \fImkcfm\fP creates summary files (.cfm files) of those
font metric files. \fImkcfm\fP should be run whenever a change is
made to the files stored in the subdirectories of the CID font
directory. For example, it should be run when new CID fonts are installed.
.TP 15
.B .cfm files
Summaries of font metric (.afm) files created by \fImkcfm\fP.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
The rasterizer for CID-keyed fonts in the directory
\fIxc/lib/font/Type1\fP.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

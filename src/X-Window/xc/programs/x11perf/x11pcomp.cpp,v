XCOMM
XCOMM Collects multiple outputs of x11perf.  Just feed it a list of files, each
XCOMM containing the output from an x11perf run, and this shell will extract the
XCOMM object/second information and show it in tabular form.  An 80-column line
XCOMM is big enough to compare 4 different servers.
XCOMM
XCOMM This script normally uses the results from $1 to extract the test label
XCOMM descriptions, so you can run x11perf on a subset of the test and then
XCOMM compare the results.  But note that x11perffill requires the labels file
XCOMM to be a superset of the x11perf results file.  If you run into an ugly
XCOMM situation in which none of the servers completes the desired tests 
XCOMM (quite possible on non-DEC servers :), you can use -l <filename> as $1 and
XCOMM $2 to force x11perfcomp to use the labels stored in file $2.  (You can run
XCOMM x11perf with the -labels option to generate such a file.)

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

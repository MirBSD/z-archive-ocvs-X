.TH OCLOCK 1 __xorgversion__
.SH NAME
oclock \- round X clock
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B oclock
[\-option ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Oclock
simply displays the current time on an analog display.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.B \-fg \fIcolor\fB
choose a different color for the both hands and the jewel of the clock
.TP 8
.B \-bg \fIcolor\fB
choose a different color for the background.
.TP 8
.B \-jewel \fIcolor\fB
choose a different color for the jewel on the clock.
.TP 8
.B \-minute \fIcolor\fB
choose a different color for the minute hand of the clock.
.TP 8
.B \-hour \fIcolor\fB
choose a different color for the hour hand of the clock.
.TP 8
.B \-backing \fI{ WhenMapped Always NotUseful }\fB
selects an appropriate level of backing store.
.TP 8
.B \-geometry \fIgeometry\fB
define the initial window geometry; see \fIX(__miscmansuffix__)\fP.
.TP 8
.B \-display \fIdisplay\fB
specify the display to use; see \fIX(__miscmansuffix__)\fP.
.TP 8
.B \-bd \fIcolor\fB
choose a different color for the window border.
.TP 8
.B \-bw \fIwidth\fB
choose a different width for the window border.  As the Clock widget changes
its border around quite a bit, this is most usefully set to zero.
.TP 8
.B \-shape
causes the clock to use the Shape extension to create an oval window.
This is the default unless the shapeWindow resource is set to false.
.TP 8
.B \-noshape
causes the clock to not reshape itself and ancestors to exactly
fit the outline of the clock.
.TP 8
.B \-transparent
causes the clock to consist only of the jewel, the hands, and the border.
.SH COLORS
If you would like your clock to be viewable in color, include the following 
in the #ifdef COLOR section you read with xrdb:
.sp 1
*customization:                 -color
.sp 1
.br
This will cause oclock to pick up the colors in the app-defaults color
customization file:
<XRoot>/lib/X11/app-defaults/Clock-color.
Below are the default colors:
.sp 1
Clock*Background: grey
.br
Clock*BorderColor: light blue
.br
Clock*hour: yellow
.br
Clock*jewel: yellow
.br
Clock*minute: yellow

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

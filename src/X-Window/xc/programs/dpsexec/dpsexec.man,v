.TH DPSEXEC 1 __vendorversion__
.SH NAME
dpsexec \- Display PostScript Executive

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dpsexec 
[
.B \-display \fIname\fR
][
.B \-sync
][
.B \-backup
][
.B \-noexec
][
.B \-root
][
.B \-drawable \fIwindowId\fR
][
.B \-height \fIn\fR
][
.B \-width \fIn\fR
]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B dpsexec
is a Display PostScript program that
allows the user to interact directly with the PostScript 
interpreter through a command interface. 
.B dpsexec 
reads lines of text from standard input and passes each line to
the PostScript interpreter for execution.
It creates a window that displays the results of graphics operations as
they are executed.
.B dpsexec
exits when end of file is reached on standard input, or when
the user types "quit<return>", which executes
the PostScript 
.B quit
operator.
.LP
By default,
.B dpsexec
executes the PostScript
.B executive
operator before it accepts any user input.
This operator puts the PostScript interpreter in "interactive
executive" mode so that the user can control the interpreter
directly. 
In this mode, the PostScript interpreter supports certain line-editing 
functions and prompts the user when it is ready to execute more input.
See section 2.4.4, "Using the Interpreter Interactively,"
of the \fIPostScript Language Reference Manual, Second Edition,\fR
for detailed information on this mode of operation. 

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-display " name"
specifies the display on which to open a connection to the Display
PostScript system. If no display is specified, the 
DISPLAY environment variable is used.
.TP
.B \-sync
establishes a synchronous connection with the specified X display.
.TP
.B \-backup
uses backing store for the window in which graphics are
displayed, if possible.  This is generally only effective with
the DPS NX system.
.TP
.B \-noexec
prevents
.B dpsexec
from entering "interactive executive" mode.  The primary effect
of this option is to 
inhibit printing the
.B PS>
prompt before each line of input is accepted.
This option is useful when 
.B dpsexec
is run with standard input redirected from a file or a pipe.
.TP
.B \-root
tells
.B dpsexec
to draw into the root window instead of into a window that it creates.
.TP
.BI \-drawable " windowId"
tells
.B dpsexec
to draw into the specified window instead of into a window that it creates.
.TP
.BI \-height " n"
sets the height of the created window.
.TP
.BI \-width " n"
sets the width of the created window.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
PostScript language error messages are printed to standard output.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

# Anyone who obtained a copy of this work is hereby permitted to freely use,
# distribute, modify, merge, sublicence, give away or sell it as long as the
# authors are given due credit and the following notice is retained:

# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-
# butor be held liable for any damage, directly or indirectly, that origina-

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

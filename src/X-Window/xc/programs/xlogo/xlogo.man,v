.TH XLOGO 1 __xorgversion__
.SH NAME
xlogo - X Window System logo
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xlogo
[-\fItoolkitoption\fP ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIxlogo\fP program displays the X Window System logo.
.SH OPTIONS
.I Xlogo
accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command line options, as well as the
following:
.TP 8
.B \-shape
This option indicates that the logo window should be shaped rather than
rectangular.
.SH RESOURCES
The default width and the default height are each 100 pixels.
This program uses the \fILogo\fP widget in the Athena widget set.  It
understands all of the Simple widget resource names and classes as well as:
.TP 8
.B foreground (\fPclass\fB Foreground)
Specifies the color for the logo.  The default is depends on whether
\fIreverseVideo\fP is specified.  If \fIreverseVideo\fP is specified
the default is \fIXtDefaultForeground\fP, otherwise the default is 
\fIXtDefaultBackground\fP.
.TP 8
.B shapeWindow (\fPclass\fB ShapeWindow) 
Specifies that the window is shaped to the X logo.  The default is False.
.SH WIDGETS
In order to specify resources, it is useful to know the hierarchy of
the widgets which compose \fIxlogo\fR.  In the notation below,
indentation indicates hierarchical structure.  The widget class name
is given first, followed by the widget instance name.
.sp
.nf
.TA .5i 
.ta .5i 
XLogo  xlogo
	Logo  xlogo
.fi
.sp
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP 8
.B DISPLAY
to get the default host and display number.
.TP 8
.B XENVIRONMENT
to get the name of a resource file that overrides the global resources
stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
.SH FILES
<XRoot>/lib/X11/app-defaults/XLogo - specifies required resources
.SH SEE ALSO
X(__miscmansuffix__), xrdb(1)
.SH AUTHORS
Ollie Jones of Apollo Computer and Jim Fulton of the MIT X Consortium
wrote the logo graphics routine, based on a graphic design by Danny
Chong and Ross Chapman of Apollo Computer.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

.B \-render
This option indicates that the logo should be drawn with anti-aliased edges using the RENDER extension.
.TP 8
.B \-sharp
If -render is also specified, this forces the edges to be rendered in sharp mode, (ie. 1-bit alpha channel).

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

#
# Anyone who obtained a copy of this work is hereby permitted to freely use,
# distribute, modify, merge, sublicence, give away or sell it as long as the

# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-
# butor be held liable for any damage, directly or indirectly, that origina-
# ted through or is caused by creation or modification of this work.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

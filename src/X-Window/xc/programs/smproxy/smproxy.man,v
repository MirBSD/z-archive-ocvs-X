.SH NAME
smproxy \- Session Manager Proxy
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B smproxy
[-clientId id] [-restore saveFile]
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.B \-clientId \fIid\fP
Specifies the session ID used by \fIsmproxy\fP in the previous session.
.TP 8
.B \-restore \fIsaveFile\fP
Specifies the file used by \fIsmproxy\fP to save state in the previous session.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIsmproxy\fP allows X applications that do not support X11R6 session
management to participate in an X11R6 session.  
.br
.sp
In order for \fIsmproxy\fP to act as a proxy for an X application, one of
the following must be true:
.br
.sp
- The application maps a top level window containing the
\fBWM_CLIENT_LEADER\fR property.  This property provides a pointer to
the client leader window which contains the \fBWM_CLASS\fR, \fBWM_NAME\fR,
\fBWM_COMMAND\fR, and \fBWM_CLIENT_MACHINE\fR properties.
.br
.sp
or ...
.br
.sp
- The application maps a top level window which does not contain the
\fBWM_CLIENT_LEADER\fR property.  However, this top level window
contains the \fBWM_CLASS\fR, \fBWM_NAME\fR, \fBWM_COMMAND\fR, and
\fBWM_CLIENT_MACHINE\fR properties.
.PP
An application that support the \fBWM_SAVE_YOURSELF\fR protocol will receive
a \fBWM_SAVE_YOURSELF\fR client message each time the session manager issues
a checkpoint or shutdown.  This allows the application to save state.  If
an application does not support the \fBWM_SAVE_YOURSELF\fR protocol, then
the proxy will provide enough information to the session manager to restart
the application (using \fBWM_COMMAND\fR), but no state will be restored.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

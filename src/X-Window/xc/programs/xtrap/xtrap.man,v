.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
These commands are 
.B "SAMPLE CLIENTS"
provided with the XTrap X Server Extension
Sources, Version 3.3.
XTrap is an X Server 
extension which facilitates the capturing of server protocol and synthesizing
core input events.
Information on how to obtain these sources can be
found in the SOURCES section below.
.LP
The 
.B xtrapreset
command
is the simplest XTrap client in that it merely performs an XQueryExtension()
against XTrap.  The name "reset" is historical.  The 
.I display
argument is parsed by the X Toolkit and specifies the display where XTrap is
to be loaded; see X(1).
.LP
.B xtrapinfo
displays general configuration information as a result of an GetAvailable
XTrap request to the specified server.  It is simply designed to test the
request/response mechanism of the XTrap extension and client library as
well as display the configuration information that it finds.
.LP
.B xtrapstats
tests the event and request vectoring of the server extension by configuring
XTrap to collect usage statistics on all core input events and requests.  It
has a primitive command-line interface for showing the counters, zeroing
out the counters, and quitting the program.
.LP
.B xtrapout
tests the output transport from the XTrap extension to the XTrap client
library.  
As an aside, since xtrapout has the capability of "recording" events and
requests it receives, 
.B xtrapout
is ideal for providing input to test 
.B xtrapin.
Since events are the only concern for the input transport, the \-e flag can
be specified to indicate that all input events (and only events) should be
recorded by
.B xtrapout.
.I script
is specified primarily for non-U*IX machines which don't support I/O 
re-direction easily.
The \-v flag is used to force recording of all requests and input events.
.LP
.B xtrapin
is used to test the input transport to the XTrap server extension.  As stated
earler, it's input can be provided by 
.B xtrapout
using the \-e qualifer.  While it's primary function is for testing XTrap
and serving as an example for XTrap functionality, it can reasonably used as
a primitive "playback" client for X sessions.
.LP
.B xtrapchar
parses ANSI character sequences including application program sequences to 
synthesize input events to X Window servers using the XTrap server extension.
The intent of this program is to serve as a sample implementation for 
interfacing character-based alternative input sources into X servers (e.g.
voice recognition systems).  Another application might be "remote keyboards".
The -v flag causes the program to display XTrap configuration information 
and echo's characters processed to stdout.  If present, this must be the 
first argument.
.LP
Note:  
.B xtrapchar 
has only been used with Digital Workstations using the 
LK201 compatible keyboard.  Though reasonable effort was done to maintain 
portability,  no claims are made as to the current level of portability to 
non-DEC servers for this program.
.LP
The
.B xtrapproto
command
is a regression test designed to test the basic XTrap protocol between a
client and server.  If a given implementation is suspect, the results of
this test should be sent to an XTrap implementor and/or developer.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.TP 4
.B "-d[isplay] \fIdisplay\fP"
Specifies the server to record from or playback to; see
.PN X(1).
.PP
.TP 4
.B "-e"
Record only (and all) events.  Should be used when creating input for
.PN xtrapin.
.PP
.TP 4
.B "-f \fIscript\fP"
The pathname of the script to be recorded / played back.
.PP
.TP 4
.B "-v"
Verbose mode.
.LP
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.LP
.B "X Toolkit Error: Can't load DEC-XTRAP extension"
.PP
The XTrap X server extension has not been linked into the specified X
server.
.SH SOURCES
.LP
.EX
Sources have been posted on UseNet systems via anonymous ftp.
They are:
East Coast (USA):   export@@lcs.mit.edu:contrib/XTrap_v32*.tar.Z

.SH IMPORTANT NOTE
.LP
.EX
Digital participated in the X Consortium's xtest working group which 
chose to evolve XTrap functionality into a new extension for X11/R6
known as the RECORD extension (XTrap input synthesis functionality is
currently covered by the XTEST extension).  It is strongly suggested
that users of XTrap technology begin developing against RECORD/XTEST
as it is the intention of the X Consortium to drive these two extensions
in the standards process for providing the protocol capturing/synthesis
functionality.  Some members of the xtest working group are actively
researching migration issues between XTrap and RECORD.  If you'd like
to contribute, please participate!  Contact your local X Consortium Rep
for details on how to be added to the xtest mailing list.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@That's what OpenBSD will, probably, ship as XF4 in 3.5
their last sync against XFree86 4.3-current has been
imported into our vendor branch, too

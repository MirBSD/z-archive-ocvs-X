.TH XLSATOMS 1 __xorgversion__
.SH NAME
xlsatoms - list interned atoms defined on server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xlsatoms
[-options ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Xlsatoms
lists the interned atoms.  By default, all atoms starting from 1 (the lowest
atom value defined by the protocol) are listed until unknown atom is found.
If an explicit range is given, \fIxlsatoms\fP will try all atoms in the range,
regardless of whether or not any are undefined.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
.TP 8
.B \-display \fIdpy\fP
This option specifies the X server to which to connect.
.TP 8
.B \-format \fIstring\fP
This option specifies a \fIprintf\fP-style string used to list each atom
\fI<value,name>\fP pair, printed in that order (\fIvalue\fP is an \fIunsigned
long\fP and \fIname\fP is a \fIchar *\fP).  \fIXlsatoms\fP will supply a
newline at the end of each line.  The default is \fI%ld\\t%s\fP.
.TP 8
.B \-range \fI[low]-[high]\fP
This option specifies the range of atom values to check.  If \fIlow\fP is not
given, a value of 1 assumed.  If \fIhigh\fP is not given, \fIxlsatoms\fP will
stop at the first undefined atom at or above \fIlow\fP.
.TP 8
.B \-name \fIstring\fP
This option specifies the name of an atom to list.  If the atom does not 
exist, a message will be printed on the standard error.
.PP
.SH "SEE ALSO"
X(__miscmansuffix__), Xserver(1), xprop(1)
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP 8
.B DISPLAY
to get the default host and display to use.

1.1.9.1

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

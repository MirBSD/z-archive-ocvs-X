.TH XCONSOLE 1 __xorgversion__
.SH NAME
xconsole \- monitor system console messages with X
.SH SYNOPSIS
.ta 8n
\fBxconsole\fP	[-\fItoolkitoption\fP ...] [-file \fIfile-name\fP]
[-notify] [-stripNonprint] [-daemon] [-verbose] [-exitOnFail]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I xconsole 
program displays messages which are usually sent to /dev/console.
.SH OPTIONS
.I Xconsole
accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command line options along with the 
additional options listed below:
.TP 8
.B \-file \fIfile-name\fP
To monitor some other device, use this option to specify the device name.
This does not work on regular files as they are always ready to be read from.
.TP 8
.B \-notify \-nonotify
When new data are received from the console and the notify option is set,
the icon name of the application has " *" appended, so that it is evident
even when the application is iconified.  \-notify is the default.
.TP 8
.B \-daemon
This option causes
.I xconsole
to place itself in the background, using fork/exit.
.TP 8
.B \-verbose
When set, this option directs
.I xconsole
to display an informative message in the first line of the text buffer.
.TP 8
.B \-exitOnFail
When set, this option directs
.I xconsole
to exit when it is unable to redirect the console output.
.SH X DEFAULTS
This program uses the 
.I Athena Text
widget, look in the
.I Athena Widget Set
documentation for controlling it.
.SH WIDGETS
In order to specify resources, it is useful to know the hierarchy of
the widgets which compose \fIxconsole\fR.  In the notation below,
indentation indicates hierarchical structure.  The widget class name
is given first, followed by the widget instance name.
.sp
.nf
.TA .5i 
.ta .5i 
XConsole  xconsole
	XConsole  text
.fi
.sp
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
.TP 8
.B DISPLAY
to get the default host and display number.
.TP 8
.B XENVIRONMENT
to get the name of a resource file that overrides the global resources
stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
.SH FILES
<XRoot>/lib/X11/app-defaults/XConsole - specifies required resources
.SH "SEE ALSO"
X(__miscmansuffix__), xrdb(1), Athena Text widget
.SH AUTHOR

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-
# butor be held liable for any damage, directly or indirectly, that origina-

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

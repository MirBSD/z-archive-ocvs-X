.SH NAME
xstdcmap - X standard colormap utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xstdcmap
[-all] [-best] [-blue] [-default] [-delete \fImap\fP] [-display \fIdisplay\fP]
[-gray] [-green] [-help] [-red] [-verbose]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fIxstdcmap\fP utility can be used to selectively define standard colormap
properties.  It is intended to be run from a user's X startup script to
create standard colormap definitions in order to facilitate sharing of
scarce colormap resources among clients.  Where at all possible, colormaps
are created with read-only allocations.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The following options may be used with \fIxstdcmap\fP:
.TP 8
.B \-all
This option indicates that all six standard colormap properties should be
defined on each screen of the display.  Not all screens will support 
visuals under which all six standard colormap properties are meaningful.
\fIxstdcmap\fP will determine the best 
allocations and visuals for the colormap properties of a screen. Any
previously existing standard colormap properties will be replaced.
.TP 8
.B \-best
This option indicates that the RGB_BEST_MAP should be defined.
.TP 8
.B \-blue 
This option indicates that the RGB_BLUE_MAP should be defined.
.TP 8
.B \-default
This option indicates that the RGB_DEFAULT_MAP should be defined.
.TP 8
.B \-delete \fImap\fP
This option specifies that a specific standard colormap property, or
all such properties, should be removed.
\fImap\fP may be one of: default, best, red, green, blue, gray, or all.
.TP 8
.B \-display \fIdisplay\fP
This option specifies the host and display to use; see \fIX(__miscmansuffix__)\fP.
.TP 8
.B \-gray
This option indicates that the RGB_GRAY_MAP should be defined.
.TP 8
.B \-green
This option indicates that the RGB_GREEN_MAP should be defined.
.TP 8
.B \-help
This option indicates that a brief description of the command line arguments
should be printed on the standard error.  This will be done whenever an
unhandled argument is given to
.I xstdcmap.
.TP 8
.B \-red
This option indicates that the RGB_RED_MAP should be defined.
.TP 8
.B \-verbose
This option indicates that \fIxstdcmap\fP should
print logging information as it parses its input and defines the
standard colormap properties.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
.TP 8
.B DISPLAY
to get default host and display number.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

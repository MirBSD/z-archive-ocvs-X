Just click on the version numbers above to download them.

<p>
Older releases of fvwm1 and fvwm2 and (for the brave) the latest alpha
and beta releases, as well as unofficial patches, can be found
<a href="ftp://ftp.fvwm.org/pub/fvwm/">here</a>.

<p>
Please keep in mind that the Beta code can potentially become
unstable or buggy at any time, so USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
Of course you may find bugs in "Official" versions also.

<p>
If you find any bugs, you can enter them into the
<a href="http://www.fvwm.org/cgi-bin/fvwm-bug">FVWM Bug Tracking System</a>.
If possible, please try searching to see if someone else has already
reported this bug.  If you have more or better information, feel
free to add a note!

<p>
If you just have a question, be sure to read our
<a href="docs.html">Documentation</a> first, then you might want to
try our <a href="mailinglist.html">Mailing List</a>.

<p>
When asking for help, of course always remember to provide the release
number of fvwm, your operating system, and any other information you
think might be pertinent.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the
#       C Language, BSD/Berkeley Unix; 386BSD, NetBSD 1.1 and OpenBSD.
#
# Anyone who obtained a copy of this work is hereby permitted to freely use,
# distribute, modify, merge, sublicence, give away or sell it as long as the
# authors are given due credit and the following notice is retained:
#
# This work is provided "as is", with no explicit or implicit warranty what-
# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-
# butor be held liable for any damage, directly or indirectly, that origina-
# ted through or is caused by creation or modification of this work.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Welcome to FVWM version 2.2.5.  FVWM is a multiple large virtual desktop
window manager, originally (a looooong time ago!) derived from twm.

FVWM is intended to have a smaller memory footprint but a rich feature
set, be extremely customizable and extendible, and have a high degree of
Motif mwm compatibility.

For users of the old FVWM 1.xx, please be aware that version 2.2 has a
lot of differences.

For users of the FVWM 2.0.x betas, please be aware that version 2.2 uses
GNU autoconf/automake rather than Imake, so things will install in
different places by default.

FVWM's original author, Rob Nation (THANKS ROB!), has "retired" from
work on it, so please don't bother him with silly little things like bug
reports or enhancement requests.  Care and feeding of FVWM is now
handled by a group of people on the fvwm-workers mailing list, with many
contributions by fans everywhere.

If you have any questions, concerns, bug reports, enhancement requests,
etc., please read the files in the docs/ subdirectory first.  In
particular the FAQ, BUGS, and TODO lists.  Also, check the FVWM man page
carefully.  Next, try the FVWM mailing list.  Another excellent resource
is the official WWW page http://www.fvwm.org and the mailing list archives
found there.

For information on compiling and installing FVWM, see the INSTALL and
INSTALL.fvwm files (INSTALL is the boilerplate autoconf instruction
file; INSTALL.fvwm contains FVWM-specific details).

For known bugs, check out the BUGS, FAQ and TODO files.

For more information, see the official FVWM homepage http://www.fvwm.org/.

Have fun!

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the
#       C Language, BSD/Berkeley Unix; 386BSD, NetBSD 1.1 and OpenBSD.
#
# Anyone who obtained a copy of this work is hereby permitted to freely use,
# distribute, modify, merge, sublicence, give away or sell it as long as the
# authors are given due credit and the following notice is retained:

# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-
# butor be held liable for any damage, directly or indirectly, that origina-
# ted through or is caused by creation or modification of this work.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

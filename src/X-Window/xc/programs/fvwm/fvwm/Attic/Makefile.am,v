@* remove all GNU Automake files, we don't need them
* disable stupid "if Makefile.am isn't there, I can't build
  Makefile.in so I can't build Makefile so... huh?" stuff
* basically synch lists (base, not x11) with what is gained;
  more review needed
  XXX adjust notes
* various improvements I don't remember
* add configs from the FSF
  (with MirBSD and ekkoBSD support added by myself)
* update some FSF material
* plug some strcpy, strcat, sprintf, mktemp holes
* fix and unify the way where and how the gcc version subdirs are included

XXX someone string-"fix" roff and the gnu part (isdnd will be taken care of later)

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the
#       C Language, BSD/Berkeley Unix; 386BSD, NetBSD 1.1 and OpenBSD.
#
# Anyone who obtained a copy of this work is hereby permitted to freely use,
# distribute, modify, merge, sublicence, give away or sell it as long as the
# authors are given due credit and the following notice is retained:

# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-
# butor be held liable for any damage, directly or indirectly, that origina-
# ted through or is caused by creation or modification of this work.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

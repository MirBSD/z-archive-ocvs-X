.UC
.SH NAME
\fIFvwmAuto\fP \- the FVWM auto-raise module
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fIFvwmAuto\fP is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation will work.
The correct syntax is:
.nf
.EX
Module FvwmAuto Timeout [EnterCommand [LeaveCommand]]
.sp
AddToMenu Modules "Modules"      Title
+                 "Audio"        Module FvwmAudio
+                 "Auto"         Module FvwmAuto 300 raise lower
+                 "Buttons"      Module FvwmButtons
+                 "Ident"        Module FvwmIdent
+                 "Banner"       Module FvwmBanner
+                 "Pager"        Module FvwmPager 0 3
.EE
.fi             
The \fITimeout\fP argument is required. It specifies how long a window must
retain the keyboard input focus before the command is executed. The
delay is measured in milliseconds, and any integer 0 or greater is
acceptable.

\fIEnterCommand\fP and \fILeaveCommand\fP are optional.
\fIEnterCommand\fP is executed \fITimeout\fP milliseconds after a
window gets the input focus, \fILeaveCommand\fP is executed
\fITimeout\fP milliseconds after the window has lost focus.

"Raise" is the default for \fIEnterCommand\fP, but any fvwm2 function
is allowed. I would not use "Close" or "Destroy" with a low timeout,
though.
The \fILeaveCommand\fP can be handy for a tidy desktop. Experiment with:
.nf
.EX
Module FvwmAuto 0 Nop Lower
Module FvwmAuto 0 Nop Iconify
.EE
.SH AUTHOR
.nf
FvwmAuto just appeared one day, nobody knows how.
FvwmAuto was simply rewritten 09/96, nobody knows by whom.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.TH FvwmBanner 1.20 "Jan 28, 1994"
.UC
.SH NAME
FvwmBanner \- the FVWM Banner
.SH SYNOPSIS
FvwmBanner is intended to be spawned by fvwm.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The FvwmInitBanner displays an Fvwm Logo in the center of the screen
for 3 seconds.

.SH COPYRIGHTS
None.

.SH INITIALIZATION
Nothing interesting.

.SH INVOCATION
FvwmBanner can be invoked by binding the action 'Module FvwmBanner' to
a menu or key-stroke in the .fvwmrc file.  Fvwm will search directory
specified in the ModulePath configuration option to attempt to locate
FvwmBanner. Although nothing keeps you from launching FvwmBanner at
start-up time, you probably don't want to.  You can also give it an
optional file parameter, like 'FvwmBanner doomface.xpm' or spcify an
alternate default pixmap via configuration options.

.SH CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

.IP "*FvwmBannerPixmap \fIfile\fP"
Tells the module to display \fIfile\fP instead of the built in pixmap.

.IP "*FvwmBannerTimeout \fIsec\fP"
Tells the module to display for \fIsec\fP seconds instead of default of 3.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

                 FvwmButtons 2.0.41-plural-Z-alpha 28.03.96

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a much improved version of FvwmButtons, previously known as GoodStuff.
It provides full configuration for each button on colors, sizes, fonts etc,
more control over swallowed windows, support for popup menus and actions bound
to separate mouse buttons. See the home page for illustrative examples.

Check out the FvwmButtons home page:
  http://www.fm.unit.no/~jatotal/fvwm.html

Thanks to the folks who tried it out, commented, reported bugs and stuff,
especially those I remembered to write down here at the time, namely:

HACK:

I have tried to keep the code as clean as possible, not introducing features
that would mess things up. There is however one feature which is a hack only,
and will be removed at a later stage when introducing a more general way in
which you can achieve the same effect. That is:
  Title (options) garblebrook
The options (Left,Right,Center,Side) will probably all go, but "Side" is a
very lousy solution, not very expandable. But until I have time to think out
a nice and general way to handle real estate inside each button, it will 
have to stay to provide the Menu Loop (tm). So there.


SYNTAX:

This is the syntax of the options part of the configuration file, written 
out in approximate BNF:

	options	   :=	option options
		   |	option
	option     :=	UNSIGNED 'x' UNSIGNED
		   |	'Action' aoptions STRING
		   |	'Back' STRING
		   |	'Container' coptions
		   |	'End'
		   |	'Font' STRING
		   |	'Fore' STRING
		   |	'Frame' SIGNED
		   |	'NoSize'
		   |    'Panel' poption STRING
		   |	'Padding' UNSIGNED
		   |	'Padding' UNSIGNED UNSIGNED
		   |	'Size' UNSIGNED UNSIGNED
		   |	'Swallow' sflags STRING STRING
		   |	'Title' tflags STRING

	aoptions   :=	'(' aoptions2 ')'
		   |	NULL
	aoptions2  :=	aoption aoptions2
		   |	aoption
	aoption	   :=	'Mouse' UNSIGNED

	coptions   :=	'(' coptions2 ')'
		   |	NULL
	coptions2  :=	coption coptions2
		   |	coption
	coption	   :=	'Action' aoptions STRING
		   |	'Back' STRING
		   |	'Columns' UNSIGNED
		   |	'Font' STRING
		   |	'Fore' STRING
		   |	'Frame' SIGNED
		   |	'NoSize'
		   |	'Padding' UNSIGNED
		   |	'Padding' UNSIGNED UNSIGNED
		   |	'Size' UNSIGNED UNSIGNED
		   |	'Swallow' soptions
		   |	'Title' toptions

	poption    :=   '(up)'
		   |    '(left)'
		   |    '(down)'
		   |    '(right)'
		   |    NULL

	sflags     :=	'(' sflags2 ')'
		   |	NULL
	sflags2    :=	sflag sflags2
		   |	sflag
	sflag	   :=	'Close'
		   |	'Hints'
		   |	'Kill'
		   |	'NoClose'
		   |	'NoHints'
		   |	'NoKill'
		   |	'NoOld'
		   |	'NoRespawn'
		   |	'NoTitle'
		   |	'Respawn'
		   |	'UseOld'
		   |	'UseTitle'

	tflags     :=	'(' tflags2 ')'
		   |    NULL
	tflags2    :=	tflag tflags2
		   |	tflag
	tflag	   :=	'Center'
		   |	'Left'
		   |	'Right'
		   |	'Side'

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

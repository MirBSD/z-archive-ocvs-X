These bugs are not fixed, if you think you can help, do so.

Known bugs as of FvwmButtons-200396b:
 
 * Chuck says it doesn't redraw correctly on resizes on AIX; it requires
   full expose to do this..? Could this be a problem with the X server?

Known bugs as of FvwmButtons-080396:

 * Another problem with swallowing is when two FvwmButtons decides to swallow
   the same window, only one succeeds. Morale: modify the titles of programs
   you start to be swallowed... One simple way to try to see this error is
   to fire up two copies of the same FvwmButtons at the same time. 
   There is a define on top of FvwmButtons.c you can uncomment to get some
   debug on this; DEBUG_HANGON.
   There has also been reported problems with buttons hanging forever after
   being pressed, this might be related.

 * When you make the buttonbox small enough (= very small, less than 1x1
   pixel inside relief and padding) it exits. Should make it silently suffer
   with grace instead. Update: actually this is a problem with the swallowed
   windows, some crash when made 1x1. Otherwise the rest is fixed.

Known bugs as of FvwmButtons-070396:

 * Action commands are supposed to work also on swallowed windows, but there
   is a problem with X. After reparenting, XSelectInput is called with a mask
   including ButtonPressMask|ButtonReleaseMask, but evidently no buttonpresses
   are received, even though the program (like xload) doesn't use them for
   itself. So where is the bottleneck? Send the solution if you got it.
   OK, so I need to do SubstructureRedirectMask, and shuffle all the events
   onwards... really? No better way? Mmm.. 

Known bugs as of FvwmButtons-040396:

 * There are still some problems related to swallowed windows, but I haven't
   found a reliable way to reproduce them. What probably happens is that a
   window is created, FvwmButtons gets its name and desides to swallow it, it
   is mapped, but before it gets swallowed it fails, thus the reparent code
   does a BadWindow. 

 * When you kill many swallowed windows quickly, FvwmButtons crashes probably
   because after gracefully removing one of it's children it tries to redraw
   some other before handling more destroy_requests.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

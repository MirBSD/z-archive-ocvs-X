@Features :

 * a start button linked to a user-defined menu in the .fvwm2rc configuration
   file

 * an array of buttons representing the active application windows : the
   focused one corresponds to the depressed buton.

 * digital clock and mail indicator

 * support for pixmaps in the buttons

Options :

FvwmTaskBarFont  : default font for the buttons
 "" SelFont:     : font for the depressed buttons (the Start button uses
                   always SelFont even if depressed)
 "" Fore & Back  : fore and back colors
 "" Geometry     : window geometry (only Y coordinate is usefull)
 "" Action	 : binds action to mouse buttons.
 "" AutoStick    : the bar automatically sticks to the top or bottom of the 
                   screen
 "" UseSkipList  : only lists windows that are not in the SkipList definition
 "" UseIconNames : use preferably the icon name instead of the full window
                   title for button label
 "" SwallowModule: same as in FvwmButtons (or GoodStuff), however, the support
                   is limited and resizing is awfull.
 "" ButtonWidth  : maximum button width (min = 32)
 "" ClockFormat  : strftime string format for the digital clock
 "" BellVolume   : volume of the bell rung for mail
 "" MailBox      : mailbox path (by default /var/spool/mail/$login_name
		   (site administrator should consider changing DEFAULT_MAIL_PATH
		    in Goodies.h if it does not reflect their system's default)
		   A value of 'None' indicates not to check for mail.
 "" StartName    : label for the start button
 "" StartMenu    : fvwm popup menu to be activated when the start button
                   is pressed
 "" StartIcon    : pixmap for the start button

...and more (see the man pages!!!)

A word about the pixmaps size: the current version only centers them on
the button, neither button resize nor pixmap resize is made if the icon is
bigger than the default button size. For the font size I'm using (12pts)
the maximum height is about 16 pixels. 

This module is based on the FvwmWinList module + win95look
(see copyrights in source files)

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

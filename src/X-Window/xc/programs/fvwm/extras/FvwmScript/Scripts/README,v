@The directory ./Examples contains some examples of what can we do with
FvwmScript:

	- BellSetup: desk accessory to modify bell. This script
requires xsetup.
	- Buttons: buttons panel wich can replace FvwmButtons. 
This script support popup menu and requires xload, xclock, 
FvwmPager, TkDesk and some icons wich are located in ./some_nice_icons.
	- Date: desk accessory to setup date and time, requires
xclock and date.
	- KeyboardSetup: desk accessory to setup keyboard, requires
xsetup.
	- Quit: scritp to confirm "Logout" or "Restart computer"
	- ScreenSetup: desk accessory to customize background display
and screen saver.
	- fvwmrc: my preferred fvwm config wich use all the six scripts.


N.B. BellSetup, KeyBoardSetup and ScreenSetup save preferences to 
~/.xinit-fvwmrc. If you want to load these preferences at every startup,
you have to include the line ".xinit-fvwmrc" in your .xinitrc before
the line "fvwm".

I hope that FvwmScript will interest you. In any case, please send me a short email and
tell me what you think about FvwmScript.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

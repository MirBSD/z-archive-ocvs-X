.TH FvwmConfig 1.20 "Mar 16 1994"
.UC
.SH NAME
FvwmConfig \- the FVWM Configuration Aid (Braindead)
.SH SYNOPSIS
FvwmConfig is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation will work.
From within the .fvwmrc file, FvwmConfig is spawned as follows:
.nf
.sp
Module FvwmConfig
.sp
.fi
or from within an fvwm pop-up menu:
.nf
.sp
     AddToMenu Module-Popup "Modules" Title
     +         "Configure"      Module FvwmConfig
     +         "FvwmIdentify"   Module FvwmIdent
     +         "Banner"         Module FvwmBanner
     +         "SaveDesktop"    Module FvwmSave
.sp
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
The FvwmConfig helps users make very simple, basic changes to the
current fvwm configuration.

In order for FvwmConfig to make changes which will take effect for
future X sessions, the user's or system's .fvwmrc file must
end with the line "Read .fvwmrc-config". FvwmConfig will write its
configuration out to the file $HOME/.fvwmrc-config, thus minimizing
conflicts with other portions of the user's configuration.

Since FvwmConfig is used to edit the user's configuration, it doesn't
make much sense for it to be very configurable itself. There are no
user-specifiable configuration options for FvwmConfig.

Use of this module is discouraged, since the options it allows are
far less in variety than fvwm itself can allow.

FvwmConfig will not work as intended if ANY styles other than the
default styles are applied to it.

.SH COPYRIGHTS
The FvwmConfig program, and the concept for interfacing this module to
the Window Manager, are all original work by Robert Nation.

Copyright 1994, Robert Nation. No guarantees or warranties or anything
are provided or implied in any way whatsoever. Use this program at your

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

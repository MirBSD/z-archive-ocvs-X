.TH FvwmGoodStuff 1.20 "Jan 28 1994"
.UC
.SH NAME
FvwmGoodStuff \- the FVWM button panel module
.SH SYNOPSIS
FvwmGoodStuff is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation will work.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The FvwmGoodStuff module provides a button panel which sits on the X
terminal's root window. The user can press the buttons at any time,
and trigger invocation of a user-specified command by the window
manager. FvwmGoodStuff only works when fvwm is used as the window
manager.

The button panel can be of any configuration or geometry, and can have
monochrome or color icons to represent the actions which would be
invoked.

Note that this is the older version of FvwmButtons (decended from fvwm
1.xx GoodStuff module), which was rewritten as of fvwm beta 2.0.42 to
have more powerful configuration capabilities (see it's man page).  If
you don't want to exploit these new capabilities, or the new version
gives you troubles, you may want to use this older module instead.

.SH COPYRIGHTS
The FvwmGoodStuff program, and the concept for interfacing this module
to the Window Manager, are all original work by Robert Nation

Copyright 1993, Robert Nation. No guarantees or warranties or anything
are provided or implied in any way whatsoever. Use this program at
your own risk. Permission to use this program for any purpose is
given, as long as the copyright is kept intact.


.SH INITIALIZATION
During initialization, \fIFvwmGoodStuff\fP will search for a
configuration file which describes the button panel geometry, color,
icons, and actions. The format of this files will be described
later. The configuration file will be the one which fvwm used during
its initialization.

If the FvwmGoodStuff executable is linked to another name, ie ln -s
FvwmGoodStuff TermStuff, or if FvwmGoodStuff is invoked with a
parameter, ie Module FvwmGoodStuff TermStuff, then another module
called TermStuff can be started with a completely different
configuration than FvwmGoodStuff, simply by changing the keywords
FvwmGoodStuff??? to TermStuff???.  This way multiple button-bars can
be used.

.SH INVOCATION
FvwmGoodStuff can be invoked by inserting the line 'Module FvwmGoodStuff'
in the .fvwmrc file. This can be placed on a line by itself, if
FvwmGoodStuff is to be spawned during fvwm's initialization, or can be
bound to a menu or mouse button or keystroke to invoke it later. Fvwm
will search directory specified in the ModulePath configuration option
to attempt to locate FvwmGoodStuff.

.SH CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
The following options can be placed in the .fvwmrc file

.IP "*FvwmGoodStuffGeometry \fIgeometry\fP"
Specifies the FvwmGoodStuff window location and/or size. If the size is
not specified, FvwmGoodStuff will auto-size itself in a reasonable
manner.  The geometry is a standard X11 window geometry specification.

.IP "*FvwmGoodStuffFont \fIfont\fP"
Specifies the font to be used for labeling the buttons.

.IP "*FvwmGoodStuffRows \fIrows\fP"
Specifies the number of rows of buttons to be created. If unspecified,
2 rows will be used.

.IP "*FvwmGoodStuffColumns \fIcolumns\fP"
Specifies the number of columns of buttons to be created. If
unspecified, the number of columns will be set to the number of
buttons requested, divided by the number of rows. If both the rows and
columns are specified, but do not specify as many buttons as are
defined, then the users columns specification will be ignored.

.IP "*FvwmGoodStuffFore \fIcolor\fP"
Specifies the color for button label text and monochrome icons.

.IP "*FvwmGoodStuffBack \fIcolor\fP"
Specifies the color for the buttons.

.IP "*FvwmGoodStuff\fI[(w x h)]\fP \fIlabel icon command\fP"
Specifies a window manager built-in command, as described in the fvwm
man page, which should be executed when a button is pressed.  The
label field is the text which will be written on the button.  The icon
field specifies an X11 bitmap file or XPM color icon file, containing
the icon to display on the button.  FvwmGoodStuff will search through
the path specified in the fvwm IconPath or PixmapPath configuration
items to find the icon file.  If the optional \fI(w x h)\fP is
specified, then this button will be \fIw\fP times the normal button
width and \fIh\fP times the normal button height.  If label is "-"
then the button label will not be displayed.

If \fIcommand\fP is an fvwm Exec command, then the button will remain
pushed in until a window whose name or class matches the qouted
portion of the command is encountered.  This is intended to provide
visual feedback to the user that the action he has requested will be
performed.  If the qouted portion contains no characters, then the
button will pop out immediately.  Note that users can continue
pressing the button, and re-executing the command, even when it looks
"pressed in."

A single extension to the fvwm built-in command set is provided.  A
command of the form: '*FvwmGoodStuff junk clock.xpm Swallow "Clock" Exec
rclock' will cause FvwmGoodStuff to spawn an rclock process, and capture
the first window whose name or resource is "Clock", and display it in
the button-bar.  This is handy for applications like xclock, xbiff,
and xload.  Modules can be swallowed by specifying the module instead
of 'Exec whatever', like: '*FvwmGoodStuff - foobar Swallow "FvwmPager"
FvwmPager 0 0'.

NOTE: if you use xclock for this application, you will want to specify
xclock -padding 0.


.SH SAMPLE CONFIGURATION
The following are excepts from a .fvwmrc file which describe
FvwmGoodStuff initialization commands:

*FvwmGoodStuff(4x1) - whatever SwallowModule "Fvwm Pager" FvwmPager 0 3   
.sp
.fi

The last line is a little tricky - it spawns an FvwmPager module, and
captures it to display in a quadruple width button. Since "-" is used
for the button label, the Pager will be resized to be as big as
possible within the button's borders. "whatever", of course, is a
non-existent icon file, and will be ignored by FvwmGoodStuff.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

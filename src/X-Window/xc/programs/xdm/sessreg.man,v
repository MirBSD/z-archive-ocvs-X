.TH SESSREG 1 __xorgversion__
.SH NAME
sessreg \- manage utmp/wtmp entries for non-init clients
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sessreg
[-w \fIwtmp-file\fP]
[-u \fIutmp-file\fP]
[-l \fIline-name\fP]
[-h \fIhost-name\fP]
[-s \fIslot-number\fP]
[-x \fIXservers-file\fP]
[-t \fIttys-file\fP]
[-a]
[-d]
\fIuser-name\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fISessreg\fP is a simple program for managing utmp/wtmp
entries for xdm sessions.
.PP
System V has a better interface to /etc/utmp than BSD; it
dynamically allocates entries in the file, instead of writing them at fixed
positions indexed by position in /etc/ttys.
.PP
To manage BSD-style utmp files, \fIsessreg\fP has two strategies.  In
conjunction with xdm, the -x option counts the number of lines in /etc/ttys
and then adds to that the number of the line in the Xservers file which
specifies the display.  The display name must be specified as the
"line-name" using the -l option.  This sum is used as the "slot-number" in
/etc/utmp that this entry will be written at.  In the more general case, the
-s option specifies the slot-number directly.  If for some strange reason
your system uses a file other that /etc/ttys to manage init, the -t option
can direct
\fIsessreg\fP to look elsewhere for a count of terminal sessions.
.PP
Conversely, System V managers will not ever need to use these options (-x,
-s and -t).  To make the program easier to document and explain,
\fIsessreg\fP accepts the BSD-specific flags in the System V
environment and ignores them.
.PP
BSD and Linux also have a host-name field in the utmp file which doesn't
exist in System V.  This option is also ignored by the System V version of
\fIsessreg\fP.
.SH USAGE
.PP
In Xstartup, place a call like:
.nf

       sessreg -a -l $DISPLAY -x /usr/X11R6/lib/xdm/Xservers $USER

.fi
and in Xreset:
.nf

       sessreg -d -l $DISPLAY -x /usr/X11R6/lib/xdm/Xservers $USER
.fi
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB-w\fP \fIwtmp-file\fP"
This specifies an alternate wtmp file, instead of /usr/adm/wtmp for BSD or
/etc/wtmp for sysV.  The special name "none" disables writing records to
/usr/adm/wtmp.
.IP "\fB-u\fP \fIutmp-file\fP"
This specifies an alternate utmp file, instead of "/etc/utmp".  The special
name "none" disables writing records to /etc/utmp.
.IP "\fB-l\fP \fIline-name\fP"
This describes the "line" name of the entry.  For terminal sessions,
this is the final pathname segment of the terminal device filename
(e.g. ttyd0).  For X sessions, it should probably be the local display name
given to the users session (e.g. :0).  If none is specified, the
terminal name will be determined with ttyname(3) and stripped of leading
components.
.IP "\fB-h\fP \fIhost-name\fP"
This is set for BSD hosts to indicate that the session was initiated from
a remote host.  In typical xdm usage, this options is not used.
.IP "\fB-s\fP \fIslot-number\fP"
Each potential session has a unique slot number in BSD systems, most are
identified by the position of the \fIline-name\fP in the /etc/ttys file.
This option overrides the default position determined with ttyslot(3).
This option is inappropriate for use with xdm, the -x option is more useful.
.IP "\fB-x\fP \fIXservers-file\fP"
As X sessions are one-per-display, and each display is entered in this file,
this options sets the \fIslot-number\fP to be the number of lines in
the \fIttys-file\fP plus the index into this file that the \fIline-name\fP
is found.
.IP "\fB-t\fP \fIttys-file\fP"
This specifies an alternate file which the \fI-x\fP option will use to count
the number of terminal sessions on a host.
.IP "\fB-a\fP"
This session should be added to utmp/wtmp.
.IP "\fB-d\fP"
This session should be deleted from utmp/wtmp.  One of -a/-d must
be specified.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

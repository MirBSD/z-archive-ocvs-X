#               SEQUENT DEFAULT user $HOME/.xsession script.
#
# The user can customize this file to personalize their initial login session.
#
# Add a line between "Start of User Applications" and "End of User Applications"
# below for each application you want to start up automatically each time
# you login.  For all applications except 'xrdb', you should end the
# line with "&" so the application will run "in the background", allowing
# this .xsession script to continue on to the next application.
#
# A special note:
# Don't add a "&" to the final line in this file ("mwm"),
# since it should not be run in the background.
# When you eventually exit your 'mwm' via the Root Menu "Quit" menu item,
# that will cause this .xsession script to exit and automatically log you out.
#
# Make sure the PATH contains all of the directories needed to locate
# the initial applications started in this .xsession script.

#
# Note that the commands started in the background are run in a subshell
# (denoted by surrounding parenthesis). If not run in a subshell, a 
# background process will become a child of the program exec'ed at the end 
# of this file. When such a child dies it may become a zombie (remain
# a defunct process). 
#
# start 'xbiff' for electronic mail arrival notification
# start 'xclock' for a display of the time.
# start two 'xterm' windows, one in the upper right and one below that.

# 'sleep 1' is added to avoid all X11 programs running in parallel
# attempting to connect to the desktop X server at the same time.

# _________________________ End of User Applications _____________________
#
# Finally, start the Motif window manager ('mwm').  Again note that this
# line should not end with "&".  This way this user session will continue
# until the user selects the 'mwm' Root Menu item "Quit" which will
# cause 'mwm' to exit, and then this .xsession script will exit thereby
# terminating this xdm user session.

log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

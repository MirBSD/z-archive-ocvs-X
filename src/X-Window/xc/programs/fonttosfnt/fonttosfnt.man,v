.TH FONTTOSFNT 1 __vendorversion__
.SH NAME
fonttosfnt \- Wrap a bitmap font in a sfnt (TrueType) wrapper
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fonttosfnt
[
.I options
]
.B \-o
.I file.ttf
[
.B \-\-
]
.IR font ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Wrap a bitmap font or a set of bitmap fonts in a sfnt (TrueType or
OpenType) wrapper.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-v
Be verbose.
.TP 
.B \-c
Do not crop glyphs.  This usually increases file size, but may
sometimes yield a modest decrease in file size for small character
cell fonts (terminal fonts).
.TP 
.B \-b
Write byte-aligned glyph data.  By default, bit-aligned data is
written, which yields a smaller file size.
.TP
.B \-r
Do not reencode fonts.  By default, fonts are reencoded to Unicode
whenever possible.
.TP 
.BI \-g " n"
Set the type of scalable glyphs that we write.  If
.I n
is 0, no scalable glyphs are written; this is legal but confuses
most current software.  If
.I n
is 1, a single scalable glyph (the undefined glyph) is written; this
is recommended, but triggers a bug in current versions of
.BR FreeType .
If
.I n
is 2 (the default), a sufficiently high number of blank glyphs are
written, which works with
.B FreeType
but increases file size.
.TP 
.BI \-m " n"
Set the type of scalable metrics that we write.  If
.I n
is 0, no scalable metrics are written, which may or may not be legal.
If
.I n
is 1, full metrics for a single glyph are written, and only left
sidebearing values are written for the other glyphs.  If
.I n
is 2, scalable metrics for all glyphs are written, which increases
file size and is not recommended.  The default is 1.
.TP
.B \-\-
End of options.
.SH BUGS
Some of the font-level values, notably sub- and superscript positions,
are dummy values.
.SH SEE ALSO
X(7), Xserver(1), Xft(3x).
.I Fonts in XFree86.
.SH AUTHOR
.B Fonttosfnt

project.

@That's what OpenBSD will, probably, ship as XF4 in 3.5
their last sync against XFree86 4.3-current has been
imported into our vendor branch, too

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

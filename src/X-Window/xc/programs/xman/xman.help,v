XMAN is an X Window System manual browsing tool.



GETTING STARTED

By default, xman starts by creating a small window that contains three
"buttons" (places on which to click a pointer button).  Two of these
buttons, Help and Quit, are self-explanatory.  The third, Manual Page,
creates a new manual page browser window; you may use this button to
open a new manual page any time xman is running.

A new manual page starts up displaying this help information.  The
manual page contains three sections.  In the upper left corner are two
menu buttons.  When the mouse is clicked on either of these buttons a
menu is popped up.  The contents of these menus is described below.
Directly to the right of the menu buttons is an informational display.
This display usually contains the name of the directory or manual page
being displayed.  It is also used to display warning messages and the
current version of xman.  The last and largest section is the
information display.  This section of the application contains either a
list of manual pages to choose from or the text of a manual page.

To use xman pull down the Sections menu to select a manual section.
When the section is displayed, click the left pointer button on the name
of the manual page that you would like to see.  Xman will replace the
directory listing with the manual page you selected.

That should be enough to get you started.  Once you understand the
basics of how to use xman, take a look at the rest of this file to see
the advanced features that are available to make using xman fast and
efficient.


SCROLLING TEXT

The scroll bars are similar to xterm and xmh scroll bars; clicking the
left or right pointer button with the pointer at the bottom of the
scroll bar will scroll the text down or up one page, respectively.
Clicking with the pointer farther up the scroll bar scrolls
proportionally less than one page.  Clicking the middle button a portion
of the way down the scroll bar will move the text window that portion of
the way down the text.  Holding the middle button and moving the pointer
up and down allows the text to be scrolled dynamically.

You may also type 'f' or <space bar> to scroll down one page, and 'b' to
scroll up one page.


RESIZING WINDOWS

You can resize any of the windows in xman with your window manager, and
xman will do the best it can to resize everything internally into a
useful configuration.  The only control over the internal arrangement
that you have is moving the border between the manual page and directory
when both are displayed.  This is done by clicking and holding the any
pointer button when the cursor is over the small square (grip) on the
right side of the screen.  The grip is located on the horizontal line
which separates the panes.  The grip may be moved up and down to resize
the panes of the screen, and when the pointer button is released xman
will move the pane boundary to the newly specified location.


MENU COMMANDS

There are two ways to activate the menus.  The first is to click any
pointer button in the menu button corresponding to the menu you want to
activate.  The second method is to hold down the "Control" key and click
the left pointer button for the Options menu or the middle pointer
button for the Sections menu.  Reguardless of how the menu was
activated, selecting items is the same.

Once a menu is activated, continue to hold down the pointer button and
drag the pointer cursor over the item that you would like to activate.
Once the item that you want to select is highlighted, select it by
releasing the pointer button.  To avoid making a menu selection, move
the pointer cursor outside the menu and release the button.

Selecting one of the items in the Sections menu will display the named
directory.

The following commands are available through the Options menu:

Display Directory	Show the current section directory.

Display Manual Page	Show the current manual page.

Help			Create a help window with this text displayed.

Search			Pop up a dialogue box that allows the entire
			tree of manual pages to be searched for a
			specific name.  A keyword (apropos) search is
			also available through this dialogue box.

Show Both Screens	Split the manual page display window to display
			both the current manual page and the directory. 
Show One Screen		Return to a single screen display of either a 
			manual page or directory listing.

Remove This Man Page	Remove this manual page, do not quit.

Open New Man Page	Pop up a new manual page browser window.

Show Version		Print the current version of xman to the
			information display window.  Please include the
			version number when reporting bugs.
 
Quit			Close all xman windows and quit xman.


SUMMARY OF BASIC ACTIONS

In a menu button:

	CLICK:			Pop up a menu

In a directory, manual page, or scroll bar:

	<CONTROL> CLICK LEFT:	Pop up the Options menu.
	<CONTROL> CLICK MIDDLE:	Pop up the Sections menu.

In a  directory:

	CLICK LEFT:		Bring up named manual page
	<SHIFT> CLICK MIDDLE:	Go to manual page previously chosen.

In a manual page or apropos listing:

	<SHIFT> CLICK MIDDLE:	Go to directory of manual pages.

In scroll bars:

	CLICK LEFT:	Move down - more if pointer is near bottom
				    of window, less if at top.
	CLICK MIDDLE:	Move top of page to current pointer position.
	CLICK RIGHT:	Move up - more if pointer is near bottom
				  of window, less if at top.

SEARCHING

Xman has a built-in searching utility that allows the user to search the
entire manual page tree for a specific topic (manual page search) or a
keyword (apropos search).  The search dialogue box can be activated from
the Options menu, or by the key Control-s.  If the search is started
from the small initial topbox xman will open a new manual page if the
search was successful, and fail silently if the search was unsuccessful.

Manual page searches are performed starting in the currently displayed
section.  If no match is found then the remaining sections are searched
in the order that the sections appear in the Sections menu, starting at
the top.  The current version of xman immediately displays the first
manual page that it finds.  If the manual page cannot be found that fact
is noted in the informational display.

An apropos search will search a list of short descriptions for all
manual pages on the system and return a list of all descriptions which
contain the keyword specified.


KEYBOARD ACCELERATORS

Xman contains a set of preinstalled keyboard accelerators.  These are a
set of key bindings that perform many of the same operations as the menu
items.  Since it is not necessary to pull down the menu,  these actions
can be performed more quickly, hence the name accelerators.  

The default key bindings for xman are:

Anywhere:

	Control - c		Exit xman
	Control - h		Create the help window
	Control - n		Create a new man page
	Control - q		Exit xman
	Control - s             Create a search popup 

In a manual page, directory, or help window:

	Control - r		Remove this manual page or help display
	Control - v		Show the current version of xman

In a manual page or directory:

	Control - d		Display Directory
	Control - m		Display Man Page

In a manual page only:

	b			Page Back
	f			Page forward
	<Space>			Page forward
	1			One line forward
	2 			Two lines forward
	3 			Three lines forward
	4 			Four lines forward

Note: Control-s does not have any effect in the help window.


FURTHER INFORMATION

Xman is highly customizable.  Through the X resource database a user can
customize the look and feel of this application so that it meets a
preferred style of interaction.  Almost any configuration that is
available dynamically can be specified through resources.  This includes
changing the size, color, and fonts, starting with no topbox, showing
both screens, and rebinding the keyboard accelerators.

The information on customizing xman is contained in the xman manual
page, I will leave it to you to figure out how to find and display that
information :-)

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.TH XEV 1 __xorgversion__
.SH NAME
xev - print contents of X events
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "xev"
[\-display \fIdisplayname\fP] [\-geometry \fIgeom\fP]
[\-bw \fIpixels\fP] [\-bs \fI{NotUseful,WhenMapped,Always}\fP]
[\-id \fIwindowid\fP] [\-s] [\-name \fIstring\fP] [\-rv]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIXev\fP creates a window and then asks the X server to send it
\fIevents\fP whenever anything happens to the window (such as being moved,
resized, typed in, clicked in, etc.).  You can also attach it to an
existing window.  It is useful for seeing what causes
events to occur and to display the information that they contain.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.B \-display \fIdisplay\fP
This option specifies the X server to contact.
.TP 8
.B \-geometry \fIgeom\fP
This option specifies the size and/or location of the window.
.TP 8
.B \-bw \fIpixels\fP
This option specifies the border width for the window.
.TP 8
.B \-bs \fI{NotUseful,WhenMapped,Always}\fP
This option specifies what kind of backing store to give the window.
The default is NotUseful.
.TP 8
.B \-id \fIwindowid\fP
This option specifies that the window with the given id should be
monitored, instead of creating a new window.
.TP 8
.B \-s
This option specifies that save-unders should be enabled on the window.
.TP 8
.B \-name \fIstring\fP
This option specifies the name to assign to the created window.
.TP 8
.B \-rv
This option specifies that the window should be in reverse video.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

\fIevents\fP whenever anything happens to the window (such as it being
moved, resized, typed in, clicked in, etc.).  You can also attach it to an
existing window.  It is useful for seeing what causes events to occur and to
display the information that they contain; it is essentially a debugging and
development tool, and should not be needed in normal usage.

This option specifies the size and/or location of the window, if a window is
to be created.

The default is NotUseful. Backing store refers to the the pixels saved
off-screen when the X server maintains the contents of a window; NotUseful
means that the xev process will redraw its contents itself, as necessary.
d40 1
a40 5
This option specifies that save-unders should be enabled on the window. Save
unders are similar to backing store, but they refer rather to the saving of
pixels off-screen when the current window obscures other windows. Save
unders are only advisory, and are normally set for popup dialogs and other
transient windows.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

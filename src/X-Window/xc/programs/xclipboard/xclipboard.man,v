.TH XCLIPBOARD 1 __xorgversion__
.SH NAME
xclipboard \- X clipboard client
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBxclipboard\fP [ \fI\-toolkitoption\fP ... ] [ \fB\-w\fP ]
[ \fB\-nw\fP ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIxclipboard\fP program is used to collect and display text selections 
that are sent to the CLIPBOARD by other clients.  It is typically used to
save CLIPBOARD selections for later use.  It stores each CLIPBOARD selection
as a separate string, each of which can be selected.  Each time CLIPBOARD
is asserted by another application, \fIxclipboard\fP transfers the contents
of that selection to a new buffer and displays it in the text window.
Buffers are never automatically deleted, so you'll want to use the delete
button to get rid of useless items.
.PP
Since \fIxclipboard\fP uses a Text Widget to display the contents of the
clipboard, text sent to the CLIPBOARD may be re-selected for use in other
applications.  \fIxclipboard\fP also responds to requests for the CLIPBOARD
selection from other clients by sending the entire contents of the currently
displayed buffer.
.PP
An \fIxclipboard\fP window has the following buttons across the top:
.TP 8
.I quit
When this button is pressed, \fIxclipboard\fP exits.
.TP 8
.I delete
When this button is pressed, the current buffer is deleted and the
next one displayed.
.TP 8
.I new
Creates a new buffer with no contents.  Useful in constructing a new
CLIPBOARD selection by hand.
.TP 8
.I save
Displays a File Save dialog box.
Pressing the Accept button saves the currently
displayed buffer to the file specified in the text field.
.TP 8
.I next
Displays the next buffer in the list.
.TP 8
.I previous
Displays the previous buffer.
.SH OPTIONS
The \fIxclipboard\fP program accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command 
line options as well as the following:
.TP 8
.B \-w
This option indicates that lines of text that are too long to be displayed on
one line in the clipboard should wrap around to the following lines.
.TP 8
.B \-nw
This option indicates that long lines of text should not wrap around.  This
is the default behavior.
.SH WIDGETS
In order to specify resources, it is useful to know the hierarchy of
the widgets which compose \fIxclipboard\fR.  In the notation below,
indentation indicates hierarchical structure.  The widget class name
is given first, followed by the widget instance name.

.SH SENDING/RETRIEVING CLIPBOARD CONTENTS
Text is copied to the clipboard whenever a client asserts ownership of the
\fBCLIPBOARD\fP selection.  Text is copied from the clipboard whenever a
client requests the contents of the \fBCLIPBOARD\fP selection.  Examples of
event bindings that a user may wish to include in a resource configuration
file to use the clipboard are:

.TA .5i
.ta .5i 3.0i

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

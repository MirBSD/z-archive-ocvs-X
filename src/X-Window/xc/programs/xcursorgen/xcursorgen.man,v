.TH XCURSORGEN 1 __vendorversion__
.SH NAME
xcursorgen \- create an X cursor file from a collection of PNG images
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "xcursorgen"
.RI [ config-file ]
.RI [ output-file ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Xcursorgen reads the config-file to find the list of cursor images along
with their hotspot and nominal size information.  Xcursorgen converts all of
the images to Xcursor format and writes them to the output-file.
.P
Each line in the config file is of the form:
.br
<size> <xhot> <yhot> <filename> <ms-delay>
.br
.P
Multiple images with the same <size> are used to create animated cursors,
the <ms-delay> value on each line indicates how long each image should be
displayed before switching to the next.  <ms-delay> can be elided for static
cursors.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
Xcursor(3x)

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

Import XFree86 4.3 from OpenBSD by CTM, in the hope it's stable

@That's what OpenBSD will, probably, ship as XF4 in 3.5
their last sync against XFree86 4.3-current has been
imported into our vendor branch, too

.TH XWD 1 __xorgversion__
.SH NAME
xwd - dump an image of an X window
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "xwd"
[-debug] [-help] [-nobdrs] [-out \fIfile\fP] [-xy] [-frame] [-add \fIvalue\fP]
[-root | -id \fIid\fP | -name \fIname\fP ] [-icmap] [-screen]
[-display \fIdisplay\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I Xwd
is an X Window System window dumping utility.
.I Xwd
allows X users to store window images in a specially formatted dump
file.  This file can then be read by various other X utilities for
redisplay, printing, editing, formatting, archiving, image processing, etc.
The target window is selected by clicking the pointer in the desired window.
The keyboard bell is rung once at the beginning of the dump and twice when
the dump is completed.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.TP 8
.B "-display \fIdisplay\fP"
This argument allows you to specify the server to connect to; see \fIX(__miscmansuffix__)\fP.
.PP
.TP 8
.B "-help"
Print out the `Usage:' command syntax summary.
.PP
.TP 8
.B "-nobdrs"
This argument specifies that the window dump should not include the
pixels that compose the X window border.  This is useful in situations
where you may wish to include the window contents in a document 
as an illustration.
.PP
.TP 8
.B "-out \fIfile\fP"
This argument allows the user to explicitly specify the output
file on the command line.  The default is to output to standard out.
.PP
.TP 8
.B "-xy"
This option applies to color displays only. It selects `XY' format dumping
instead of the default `Z' format.
.PP
.TP 8
.B "-add \fIvalue\fP"
This option specifies an signed value to be added to every pixel.
.PP
.TP 8
.B "-frame"
This option indicates that the window manager frame should be included when
manually selecting a window.
.PP
.TP 8
.B "-root"
This option indicates that the root window should be selected for the
window dump, without requiring the user to select a window with the pointer.
.PP
.TP 8
.B "-id \fIid\fP"
This option indicates that the window with the specified resource id
should be selected for the window dump, without requiring the user to
select a window with the pointer.
.PP
.TP 8
.B "-name \fIname\fP"
This option indicates that the window with the specified WM_NAME property
should be selected for the window dump, without requiring the user to
select a window with the pointer.
.PP
.TP 8
.B "-icmap"
Normally the colormap of the chosen window is used to obtain RGB values.
This option forces the first installed colormap of the screen to be used
instead.
.PP
.TP 8
.B "-screen"
This option indicates that the GetImage request used to obtain the image
should be done on the root window, rather than directly on the specified
window.  In this way, you can obtain pieces of other windows that overlap
the specified window, and more importantly, you can capture menus or other
popups that are independent windows but appear over the specified window.
.PP
.TP 8
.B "-silent"
Operate silently, i.e. don't ring any bells before and after dumping
the window.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
.TP 8
.B DISPLAY
To get default host and display number.
.SH FILES
.PP
.TP 8
.B XWDFile.h
X Window Dump File format definition file.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

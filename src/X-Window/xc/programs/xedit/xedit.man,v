.SH NAME
xedit \- simple text editor for X
.SH SYNTAX
.B xedit
[
.I \-toolkitoption
\&.\|.\|. ] [
.I filename
\&.\|.\|. ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Xedit
provides a window consisting of the following four areas:
.IP "Commands Section" 25
A set of commands that allow you to exit \fIxedit\fP, save the file, or
load a new file into the edit window.
.IP "Message Window" 25
Displays \fIxedit\fP messages. In addition, this window can be also used as
a scratch pad. 
.IP "Filename Display"
Displays the name of the file currently being edited, and whether this file
is \fIRead-Write\fP or \fIRead Only\fP.
.IP "Edit Window" 25
Displays the text of the file that you are editing or creating.  
.SH OPTIONS
.I Xedit
accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command line
options (see
.IR X (__miscmansuffix__)).
The order of the command line options is not important.
.TP 8
.I filename
Specifies the file(s) that are to be loaded during start-up. This is the
file which will be edited. If a file is not specified,
.I xedit
lets you load files or create new files after it has started up.
.SH EDITING
The Athena Text widget is used for the three sections of this
application that allow text input.  The characters typed will go to
the Text widget that has the input focus, or the Text widget that the pointer
cursor is currently over.
.PP

The following keystroke combinations are defined:

.sp
.SH COMMANDS
.IP Quit 8
Quits the current editing session. If any changes have not been saved,
.I xedit 
displays a warning message, allowing the user to save them.
.IP Save 
If file backups are enabled (see RESOURCES, below)
.I xedit
stores a copy of the
original, unedited file in <prefix>\fIfile\fP<suffix>,
then overwrites the \fIfile\fP with the contents of the edit window.  The
filename is retrieved from the Text widget directly to the right of
the \fILoad\fP button.
.IP Load
Loads the file named in the text widget immediately to the right
of the this button and displays it in the Edit window.
.SH RESOURCES
For \fIxedit\fP the available resources are:
.TP 8
.B enableBackups (\fPClass\fB EnableBackups)
Specifies that, when edits made to an existing file are saved,
.I xedit
is to copy the original version of that file to <prefix>\fIfile\fP<suffix>
before it saves the changes.  The default value for this resource is
``on,'' stating that backups should be created.
.TP 8
.B backupNamePrefix (\fPClass\fB BackupNamePrefix)
Specifies a string that is to be prepended to the backup filename.  The
default is that no string shall be prepended.
.TP 8
.B backupNameSuffix (\fPClass\fB BackupNameSuffix)
Specifies a string that is to be appended to the backup filename.  The
default is to use ``~'' as the suffix.
.TP 8
.B positionFormat (\fPClass\fB Format)
Specifies a format string used to display the cursor position.  This
string uses printf(3) like notation, where
.B %l
prints the line number,
.B %c
prints the column number,
.B %p
prints the insert position offset, and
.B %s
prints the current file size.  It is also allowed to specifie field sizes,
with the notation
.B %\-?[0\-9]+
\&.  The default format string is ``L%l'', which shows the character ``L''
followed by the line number.
.TP 8
.B hints (\fPClass\fB Hints)
Specifies a list of strings, separated by new lines, that will be
displayed in the bc_label window.
.TP 8
.B hintsInterval (\fPClass \fBInterval)
Specifies the interval in seconds, which the hint string in the bc_label
window will be changed.
.TP 8
.B changedBitmap (\fPClass \fBBitmap)
Specifies the name of the Bitmap that will be displayed in the fileMenu, when
the file being edited is changed.
.TP 8
.B autoReplace (\fPClass \fBReplace)
This resource is useful to automatically correct common mispelling errors, but
can also be used to create simple macros. The format is
\fI{non-blanks}{blanks}[{string}]\fP. Fields are separeted by newlines.
Example of use:
\"
.br
.nf
nto	  not\\n\\
/macro some long string with \\\\\\n newlines \\\\\\n
.fi
\"
.br
Will automatically replace the word \fInto\fP by \fInot\fP, and \fI/macro\fP
by \fIsome long string with
 newlines
\fP
when you type that words.
.TP 8
.B ispell.dictionaries (\fPClass \fBispell.Dictionary)

When enabled, runs ispell in terse mode, not asking user interaction for words
generated through compound formation (when using the ispell ``-C'' option), or
words generated through affix removal. The default value is False.
.TP 8
.B ispell.lookCommand (\fPClass \fBispell.CommandLine)
The path to the program to search for alternate words, and possibily,
additional arguments. The default program used is \fI/usr/bin/egrep\fP.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

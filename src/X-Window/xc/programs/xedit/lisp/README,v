    SUMMARY

  This is a small lisp interpreter for xedit. It implements a subset of
Common Lisp and the xedit package implements several of the basic Emacs
lisp functions.

(shared modules not broken, but needs a redesign for better performance,
 but won't be made available in the default build probably for a long time,
 it would be really better to generate the interface dinamically, and/or just
 link agains't the required libraries and use a ffi interface)
+------------------------------------------------------------------------
|   It has a very simple method for loading shared modules, slightly based on
| the XFree86 loader code, that is currently disabled by default. To enable it,
| edit lisp.cf and change BuildSharedLispModules to YES.
|
|   Assuming you have built it with BuildSharedLispModules enabled, you can build
| a small test application can be built in this directory running "make lsp".
| Two lisp programs are available in the test directory. To test the programs
| run "./lsp test/hello.lsp" or "./lsp test/widgets.lsp".
+------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Currently, it should be used as an helper and/or a small calculator embedded
in xedit. For the future it should be possible to write entire interfaces
in the xedit text buffers.


    USAGE SUMMARY

  To evaluate lisp expressions, put the text cursor just after the
lisp expression and press:
C-x,C-e	- will evaluate it, and print the result to the message window
C-j	- will evaluate it, and print the result to the edit window, any
	  errors are printed to the message window.
C-g	- will send an SIGINT to the lisp process, and that process will
	  stop whatever it was processing and jump to the toplevel,
	  to wait for more input.

Note that C-j will only work in the *scratch* buffer.


     NOTES

  The improvements to xedit including the several possibilites to extend
the editor using Lisp are expected to allow making of xedit a versatile
text editor for programming, but there is code being (slowly) developed
that should also make it useable as a small word processor, for things
like WYSIWYG html, etc.
  The xedit development is being done very slowly, maybe it will get
somewhere someday, but it is a pet/hobby project, there is no intention
of making of it an end user editor (the idea is to make it an useful
development tool).
  In some aspects the development is trying to mimic several Emacs
features, but there is no intention of competition (if xedit ever get
something better than Emacs, I hope that it serves as a motivation to
make of Emacs an even better editor), actually it is expected to explore
different areas and use alternate solutions for the implementation.
  Most work in a computer is done in a text editor and the more the editor
can help the user the better.


(debugger is broken and very slow, no prevision for fixing it, but is
 expected to work correctly for interpreted only code)
+------------------------------------------------------------------------
|     DEBUGGER
|
|   There is a, currently, very simple debugger implement in the interpreter.
| The debugger is now optional, and off by default. To make it available,
| you need to recompile with -DDEBUGGER.
| To use the debugger, run the lsp sample program as "./lsp -d", and optionally
| pass a second parameter, for the file to be interpreted. Once the debugger
| prompt is visible, type "help" for a summary of options. To leave the debugger
| type "continue".
|   Note that the debugger is still very simple, it won't work from xedit, and
| won't drop to the debugger on "fatal errors". It allows adding breakpoints to
| functions and watchpoints to variables. Support for changing data and going to
| the debugger on fatal errors should be added at some time.
+------------------------------------------------------------------------


    COMPILER

  Now there is a very simple bytecode compiler. It is far from finished, but
for simple code can show significant better performance.
  There is not yet an interface to compile entire files and no interface to
store the generated bytecode in disk. There is an interface to bytecode
compile toplevel forms as a LAMBDA NIL, but it is not yet exported.
  If your code needs to call GO/RETURN/RETURN-FROM as the result of an EVAL,
it must jump to code in the interpreter, after compiling all calls to
GO/RETURN/RETURN-FROM are just stack adjusting and jumps in the bytecode.
CATCH/THROW and UNWIND-PROTECT are running as interpreted code for now, so it
is safe to use these, but code in such blocks is not compiled/optimized
(not even macro expansion is done, as it understands that while not compiled,
everything is candidate to redefinition at any time).
  To compile the code, just write a function, and compile it, example:

	(defun fact (n)
	    (if (< n 2)
		1
		(* n (fact (1- n)))
	    )
	)
	FACT

	(compile 'fact)
	FACT
	NIL
	NIL

	(disassemble 'fact)
	Function FACT:
	1 required argument: N
	0 optional arguments
	0 keyword parameters
	No rest argument

	Bytecode header:
	1 element used in the stack
	2 elements used in the builtin stack
	0 elements used in the protected stack
	Constant 0 = 1
	Constant 1 = (2)
	Symbol 0 = N
	Builtin 0 = *
	Builtin 1 = 1-
	Builtin 2 = <

	Initial stack:
	0 = N

	Bytecode stream:
	   0  LOAD&PUSH (0)
	   2  LOADCON&PUSH [1]	    ;  (2)
	   4  CALL 2 [2]	    ;  <
	   7  JUMPNIL 8
	  10  LOADCON [0]	    ;  1
	  12  NOOP
	  13  JUMP 19
	  16  LOAD&PUSH (0)
	  18  LOAD&PUSH (0)
	  20  CALL 1 [1]	    ;  1-
	  23  LET* [0]		    ;  N
	  25  LETREC 1
	  27  UNLET 1
	  29  BCONS1
	  30  CALL 1 [0]	    ;  *
	  33  RETURN
	FACT


  There are several optimizations that should be done at some time, I don't
think adding NOOP opcodes will help everywhere to make aligned memory reads
of shorts and ints.
  It should have explicitly visible registers, not the abstraction of "the
current value", so the code generator can choose register allocation for
loop control variables, commonly used variables, etc, for example. Jumps
should have 3 types: byte relative, 2 bytes relative and 4 bytes relative.
For now there is only 2 byte relative jumps, byte relative jumps
can show a significant performance increase, but they are disable until
it is decided how inlined functions will work, if it just updates the bytecode
header and cut&past the bytecode, jumps must be updated, and some jumps
may not fit anymore in a byte.


    OPTIMIZATION

  There are plenty of possibilities to make the interpreter run faster. Some
optimizations that can make it run quite faster in certain cases are:
  o Better object memory layout and gc. The current memory allocation code
    is very bad, it try to keep 3 times more free objects than the currently
    used number, this can consume a lot of memory. The reason is to reduce
    the gc time cost so that it will in average miss only one in every 4
    collect tries.
  o Implement real vectors, currently they are just a list, so it cannot
    just deference a given index, and gc time is very long also.
  o Most lists are never changed once created, it could somehow add an index
    field in the cons cell, so that NTH/NTHCDR/LENGTH like code could just
    deference the correct object, instead of traversing the CDR of every
    cons. This would probably require implementing lists as vectors, while
    making it easy to deference would make life harder when deleting/inserting
    sublists in a list. It should also better be done in a way that does
    not require a lot of objects allocated linearly.

  This is a small lisp interpreter for xedit. In the current implementation,
it is just reading from stdin and writing to stdout/stderr. The code in xedit
just wraps these and read/write from a pipe to the lisp interpreter. This
is expected to change at some time, so that it should be possible to manage
the xedit text buffers from lisp code.

  It has a very simple method for loading shared modules, slightly based on
the XFree86 loader code, that is currently disabled by default. To enable it,
edit lisp.cf and change BuildSharedLispModules to YES.

  Assuming you have built it with BuildSharedLispModules enabled, you can build
a small test application can be built in this directory running "make lsp".
Two lisp programs are available in the test directory. To test the programs
run "./lsp hello.lsp" or "./lsp widgets.lsp".

in the xedit text buffers. The code is expected to be very stable, and by
using it, xedit should not crash in any way (actually, it can't, as the
lisp is running in a separate process). The lisp process is started once the
first eval is called.

    IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
d48 139
a186 174
  The interpreter is expected to be a subset of Common Lisp, and is not
expected to invent any new features or interfaces, just become more and
more compatible with Common Lisp. The only non Common Lisp features, currently
is/are:

  o It has some Emacs Lisp functions, that should be removed and replaced with
    the Common Lisp equivalent ones.


  The currently implemented function names are in table.gperf. There are also
functions in modules/fun.lsp, that are inplicitly loaded by xedit and the
sample program lsp.


    BUGS

  If (print) is called with a circular list as argument, the lisp interpreter
will crash. A code for circular list detection was written, but removed as
it was buggy.
  The (gc) code was slightly changed to avoid circular lists, but the code
is not correct, so (gc) may need to be called several times to get deep enough
on some more complex data structures, and free it. But calling (gc) explicitly
is not required, as it will be called every time there are not enough available
cells.


    WHY?

  I have used Emacs for a long time, and since I was working as volunteer to
make of Xaw a better user interface, xedit seemed to need some work. For at
least 3 years now, I don't use any other text editor than xedit, unless I
need for some reason to work on the text console (like when debugging the
xserver or xfs).

  The lisp code was mostly written for some years, but not incorporated in
xedit. Since the Lisp language is unlikely to change from day to night, it
can be safely incorporated in xedit. Contrarily to this is an html
viewer/editor to xedit I have been writing for some years. I wish I could add
it to Xaw/xedit soon, but unfortunately it is still unstable, and not
functional.


    NOTE

  The lisp interpreter is mean't to be usable without xedit and without Xaw.
The xedit text buffer interface, when done will be just a module.
  If you want to test the current implementation, subject to changes, as it
is only for testing, create a file named "xedit.lsp", with the contents:
--
;; (provide "xedit")

(defun point ()
    (format t "get-point~%")
    (read)	;; current point
)

(defun point-min ()
    (format t "point-min~%")
    (read)	;; minimal point value
)

(defun point-max ()
    (format t "point-max~%")
    (read)	;; maximal point value
)

(defun goto-char (point)
    (format t "set-point ~D~%" point)
    (read)	;; nil return value
    point
)

(defun insert (str)
    (format t "insert ~S~%" str)
    (read)	;; nil return value
)

(defun get-background-color ()
    (format t "get-background~%")
    (read)	;; current background color
)

(defun set-background-color (color)
    (format t "set-background ~S~%" color)
    (read)	;; nil return value
)

(defun get-font ()
    (format t "get-font~%")
    (read)	;; current font
)

(defun set-font (font)
    (format t "set-font ~S~%" font)
    (read)	;; nil return value
)

(defun get-foreground-color ()
    (format t "get-foreground~%")
    (read)	;; current foreground color
)

(defun set-foreground-color (color)
    (format t "set-foreground ~S~%" color)
    (read)	;; nil return value
)

(defun other-buffer ()
    (format t "get-other-buffer~%")
    (read)	;; value of other buffer
)
--
Note that it is printing a literal ESC.
  After creating the file xedit.lsp, at the *scratch* buffer, type
(load "xedit.lsp") and press Ctrl+J. After that, you should be able to use
the defined functions. Try this:
(set-background-color "PeachPuff")
(set-foreground-color "Red3")
(goto-char (point-min))


    DEBUGGER

  There is a, currently, very simple debugger implement in the interpreter.
To use the debugger, run the lsp sample program as "./lsp -d", and optionally
pass a second parameter, for the file to be interpreted. Once the debugger
prompt is visible, type "help" for a summary of options. To leave the debugger
type "continue".
  Note that the debugger is still very simple, it won't work from xedit, and
won't drop to the debugger on "fatal errors". It allows adding breakpoints to
functions and watchpoints to variables. Support for changing data and going to
the debugger on fatal errors should be added soon.


    STRUCTURE IMPLEMENTATION OVERVIEW

    Assuming structure person is created as:
	(defstruct person age first-name last-name)
    The interpreter will gc protect the arguments in the list DEF defined as
	(person age first-name last-name), and create the special atoms:
	make-person	  with structure property DEF function STRUCT_CONSTRUCTOR
	person-p	  with structure property DEF function STRUCT_CHECK
	person-age	  with structure property DEF function 0
	person-first-name with structure property DEF function 1
	person-last-name  with structure property DEF function 2
    When an accessor function is called, as in:
	(person-age (make-person :age 30))
    The evaluator will internally translate the code to:
	(xedit::struct-access 'person-age (xedit::make-struct 'make-person :age 30))
    The function xedit::struct-access will fetch the structure property
from the atom person-age to determine the offset, and also make sure it's
argument is of type person. The function xedit::make-struct only checks that
the structure property is set to the atom person, and that the age field is
a person field name.
    It is possible to override the setf method for structures, but a suitable
one is constructed, for example:
	(setf (person-first-name some-person) 'MARIA)
    Internally, it will be evaluated as this definition where provided:
	(defsetf person-first-name (struct) (value)
	    `(xedit::struct-store 'person-first-name ,struct ,value))
    And the code executed is:
	(xedit::struct-store 'person-first-name some-person 'MARIA)
    Type checking is also done with a single function, as the code:
	(person-p some-person)
    Is internally translated to:
	(xedit::struct-type 'person-p some-person)
    The current structure implementation, like almost everything in the
interpreter is very simple, and calling any of the xedit::* functions
explicitly is unsupported.
    Structure redefinition is supported, but not encouraged, and you should
do it only when sure no instances of the previous definition exists, previous
access method functions are only removed if the new definition has a field
with the same name, and calling the new methods on old objects will generate
errors.

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,

This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change

to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86

	FACT
	NIL
	NIL

	(disassemble 'fact)
	Function FACT:
	1 required argument: N
	0 optional arguments
	0 keyword parameters
	No rest argument

	Bytecode header:
	1 element used in the stack
	2 elements used in the builtin stack

	Constant 0 = 1
	Constant 1 = (2)
	Symbol 0 = N
	Builtin 0 = *
	Builtin 1 = 1-
	Builtin 2 = <

	Initial stack:
	0 = N

	Bytecode stream:
	   0  LOAD&PUSH (0)

  This is a small lisp interpreter for xedit. It implements a subset of
Common Lisp and the xedit package implements several of the basic Emacs
lisp functions.

(shared modules not broken, but needs a redesign for better performance,
 but won't be made available in the default build probably for a long time,
 it would be really better to generate the interface dinamically, and/or just
 link agains't the required libraries and use a ffi interface)
+------------------------------------------------------------------------
|   It has a very simple method for loading shared modules, slightly based on
| the XFree86 loader code, that is currently disabled by default. To enable it,
| edit lisp.cf and change BuildSharedLispModules to YES.
|
|   Assuming you have built it with BuildSharedLispModules enabled, you can build
| a small test application can be built in this directory running "make lsp".
| Two lisp programs are available in the test directory. To test the programs
| run "./lsp test/hello.lsp" or "./lsp test/widgets.lsp".

  The improvements to xedit including the several possibilites to extend
the editor using Lisp are expected to allow making of xedit a versatile
text editor for programming, but there is code being (slowly) developed
that should also make it useable as a small word processor, for things
like WYSIWYG html, etc.
  The xedit development is being done very slowly, maybe it will get
somewhere someday, but it is a pet/hobby project, there is no intention
of making of it an end user editor (the idea is to make it an useful
development tool).
  In some aspects the development is trying to mimic several Emacs
features, but there is no intention of competition (if xedit ever get
something better than Emacs, I hope that it serves as a motivation to
make of Emacs an even better editor), actually it is expected to explore
different areas and use alternate solutions for the implementation.
  Most work in a computer is done in a text editor and the more the editor
can help the user the better.


(debugger is broken and very slow, no prevision for fixing it, but is
 expected to work correctly for interpreted only code)
+------------------------------------------------------------------------
|     DEBUGGER
|
|   There is a, currently, very simple debugger implement in the interpreter.
| The debugger is now optional, and off by default. To make it available,
| you need to recompile with -DDEBUGGER.
| To use the debugger, run the lsp sample program as "./lsp -d", and optionally
| pass a second parameter, for the file to be interpreted. Once the debugger
| prompt is visible, type "help" for a summary of options. To leave the debugger
| type "continue".
|   Note that the debugger is still very simple, it won't work from xedit, and
| won't drop to the debugger on "fatal errors". It allows adding breakpoints to
| functions and watchpoints to variables. Support for changing data and going to
| the debugger on fatal errors should be added at some time.
+------------------------------------------------------------------------


    COMPILER

  Now there is a very simple bytecode compiler. It is far from finished, but
for simple code can show significant better performance.
  There is not yet an interface to compile entire files and no interface to
store the generated bytecode in disk. There is an interface to bytecode
compile toplevel forms as a LAMBDA NIL, but it is not yet exported.
  If your code needs to call GO/RETURN/RETURN-FROM as the result of an EVAL,
it must jump to code in the interpreter, after compiling all calls to
GO/RETURN/RETURN-FROM are just stack adjusting and jumps in the bytecode.
CATCH/THROW and UNWIND-PROTECT are running as interpreted code for now, so it
is safe to use these, but code in such blocks is not compiled/optimized
(not even macro expansion is done, as it understands that while not compiled,
everything is candidate to redefinition at any time).
  To compile the code, just write a function, and compile it, example:

	(defun fact (n)
	    (if (< n 2)
		1
		(* n (fact (1- n)))
	    )
	)
	FACT

	(compile 'fact)
	FACT
	NIL
	NIL

	(disassemble 'fact)
	Function FACT:
	1 required argument: N
	0 optional arguments
	0 keyword parameters
	No rest argument

	Bytecode header:
	1 element used in the stack
	2 elements used in the builtin stack
	0 elements used in the protected stack
	Constant 0 = 1
	Constant 1 = (2)
	Symbol 0 = N
	Builtin 0 = *
	Builtin 1 = 1-
	Builtin 2 = <

	Initial stack:
	0 = N

	Bytecode stream:
	   0  LOAD&PUSH (0)
	   2  LOADCON&PUSH [1]	    ;  (2)
	   4  CALL 2 [2]	    ;  <
	   7  JUMPNIL 8
	  10  LOADCON [0]	    ;  1
	  12  NOOP
	  13  JUMP 19
	  16  LOAD&PUSH (0)
	  18  LOAD&PUSH (0)
	  20  CALL 1 [1]	    ;  1-
	  23  LET* [0]		    ;  N
	  25  LETREC 1
	  27  UNLET 1
	  29  BCONS1
	  30  CALL 1 [0]	    ;  *
	  33  RETURN
	FACT


  There are several optimizations that should be done at some time, I don't
think adding NOOP opcodes will help everywhere to make aligned memory reads
of shorts and ints.
  It should have explicitly visible registers, not the abstraction of "the
current value", so the code generator can choose register allocation for
loop control variables, commonly used variables, etc, for example. Jumps
should have 3 types: byte relative, 2 bytes relative and 4 bytes relative.
For now there is only 2 byte relative jumps, byte relative jumps
can show a significant performance increase, but they are disable until
it is decided how inlined functions will work, if it just updates the bytecode
header and cut&past the bytecode, jumps must be updated, and some jumps
may not fit anymore in a byte.


    OPTIMIZATION

  There are plenty of possibilities to make the interpreter run faster. Some
optimizations that can make it run quite faster in certain cases are:
  o Better object memory layout and gc. The current memory allocation code
    is very bad, it try to keep 3 times more free objects than the currently
    used number, this can consume a lot of memory. The reason is to reduce
    the gc time cost so that it will in average miss only one in every 4
    collect tries.
  o Implement real vectors, currently they are just a list, so it cannot
    just deference a given index, and gc time is very long also.
  o Most lists are never changed once created, it could somehow add an index
    field in the cons cell, so that NTH/NTHCDR/LENGTH like code could just
    deference the correct object, instead of traversing the CDR of every
    cons. This would probably require implementing lists as vectors, while
    making it easy to deference would make life harder when deleting/inserting
    sublists in a list. It should also better be done in a way that does
    not require a lot of objects allocated linearly.

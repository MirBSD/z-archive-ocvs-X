@A joint production of:

	Adam de Boor		University of California,  Berkeley

	David Rosenthal
	Stuart Marks
	Robin Schaufler
	Mike Schwartz
	Frances Ho
	Geoff Lee
	Mark Opperman		Sun Microsystems

	Bob Scheifler		MIT Laboratory for Computer Science
	Keith Packard

This version of the Sun X11 drivers uses ../mi,  ../mfb and ../cfb to support
the following configurations:

	Sun/2		bw2	cg2/3/5
	Sun/3		bw2	cg2/3/4/5
	Sun/4		bw2	cg2/4
	SPARCstation		cg3/6
	Sun/386i	mono	color

The following configurations are NOT supported:

	Sun/1		bw1	cg1	(requires separate port)
	Sun/2			gp	(use /dev/cgtwo0)
	Sun/3			gp	(use /dev/cgtwo0)
	Sun/4			gp	(use /dev/cgtwo0)

The mfb and cfb code has been substantially tuned for 1- and 8-bit framebuffers
(with code for both fast and slow cpu-to-memory ratios).  It installs and runs
on these configurations under SunOS 3.2, 3.4, and 4.0.  However, we must stress
that it is completely unsupported, and if you have problems installing or using
it you are on your own.


Things to check before building:

1)	config/sun.cf - set the SunOSMajorVersion and SunOSMinorVersion 
	parameters to the right values.

2)	config/Project.tmpl - check LIBDIR, FONTDIR, etc.; set 
	define LibDir, FontDir, etc. in site.def as required.



Then build the system by:

1)	Go for it.  In the top-level directory, type

	make World

	This takes about forty minutes on a 4/260, and somewhat longer
	on other Suns.


2)	Go for it.  In the top-level directory, type

	make install

	Otherwise, you'll want to create a bunch of symbolic links to
	the various executables and data files scattered throughout
	the hierarchy.



3)	On the console, or from an rlogin connection, put whatever you
	chose for BINDIR (in Imake.tmpl) in your search path, and then
	start the server:

	    xinit
	or
	    xinit -- -dev /dev/??? [see below]

	If it's from the console,  you probably want to redirect the
	output thus:

	    xinit >& /tmp/x11.out

4)	xinit should start up an xterm window that acts as a console.  When
	this xterm terminates, the xinit will kill the server.  You can also
	start up client programs from a terminal or rlogin, but you must
	first set the DISPLAY environment variable:

	    setenv DISPLAY unix:0
	    xterm &


5)	Make sure that you have special devices in /dev for the appropriate 
	framebuffer.  See the manual page for Xsun for details or run the
	constype program. VME systems require special .o files when more
        than one of a particular frame buffer type is installed.


6)	In general,  Xsun auto-configures to use all the available framebuffers
	(see the Xsun manual page).  In some circumstances, you may need to 
	use the -dev switch on the command line to specify a specific device
	to use.  In particular, on the GP, GP+, and GP2, you'll need to
	specify -dev /dev/cgtwo0 your xdm Xservers file or your xinit script.


7)	To shut the server down,  send it a Hangup or Terminate signal.


8)	If X crashes, it will leave the keyboard in a funny state.  There is a
	program called "kbd_mode" that will reset the mode of the keyboard.
	"kbd_mode -a" is the appropriate setting for the bare console, and
	"kbd_mode -e" is the appropriate setting for running with SunWindows.
	You may have to issue this command from a terminal or from an rlogin
	connection.  If you run from the bare console, you can give the
	command

	xinit ; kbd_mode -a

	so that the keyboard mode will ALWAYS be set properly when the server
	terminates.

1.1.9.1

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

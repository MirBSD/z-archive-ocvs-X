.TH CONSTYPE 1 __xorgversion__
.SH NAME
constype \- print type of Sun console
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "constype"
[
.I device_name
] [
.B \-num
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.I constype
program
writes on the standard output the Sun code for the type of display
that the console is.
The types output include these:
.sp 2
.in +0.5i
.nf
bw?	Black and White, where ? is 1-4. (eg) 3-50s are bw2
cg?	Colour Graphics display, where ? is 1-4
gp?	Optional Graphics Processor board, where ? is 1-2
ns?	Not Sun display \(em where ? is A-J
.fi
.in -0.5i
.sp 2
This is useful in determining startup values and defaults for window
systems.
.LP
The
.I device_name
argument, if given, is the device to examine.
If not given,
.I /dev/fb
is used.
.LP
The
.B \-num
option causes
.I constype
to follow the type keyword with the numeric value of that type,
as returned by the FBIOGATTR or FBIOGTYPE ioctl and defined in fbio.h.
This is useful if the type is not recognized by the program.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
The program exits with status 0 if it identified a known console type,
1 if the type was unknown, and 2 if the device could not be opened or
another error occurred.
.SH BUGS
Not tested on all monitor types

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

/*
 * The CG8 is similar to the CG4 in that it has a mono plane, an enable 
 * plane, and a color plane. While the CG4 only has an 8-bit color
 * plane the CG8 has a 24-bit color plane. 
 *
 * If you have a CG4 you know that you can switch between the mono and
 * the color screens merely by dragging the pointer off the edge of the
 * screen, causing the other screen to be switched in. However this is
 * the cause of some consternation on the part of those people who have
 * both a CG4 and another frame buffer.
 *
 * Because of this problem, and some other considerations, I have chosen
 * to ignore the mono plane of the CG8 in this code.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

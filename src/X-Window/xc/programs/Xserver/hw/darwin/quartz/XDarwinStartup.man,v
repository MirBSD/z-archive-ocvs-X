.TH XDarwinStartup 1
.SH NAME
XDarwinStartup - Startup program for the XDarwin X window server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B XDarwinStartup
[\fI-iokit\fP]
[\fI-fullscreen\fP]
[\fI-rootless\fP]
[\fI-quartz\fP]
[\fI-idle\fP]
[\fIoptions\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIXDarwin(1)\fP X window server can be run in a variety of different
modes and is actually two different executables. The IOKit X server,
XDarwin, is used when running from the console. It is most commonly
located in __XBinDir__. The Quartz X server, for running in parallel with
Aqua, is a full-fledged Mac OS X application that can be started from
the Finder. Its application bundle is XDarwin.app, which is typically
located in /Applications.
.I XDarwinStartup
allows easy switching between these X servers and auto-detection of the
appropriate one to use when launching from the command line.
When run without any arguments,
.I XDarwinStartup
will start the Quartz X server if the Core Graphics window server
is currently running. Otherwise it will start the IOKit X server.
.PP
To locate the Quartz X server,
.I XDarwinStartup
will try to read the soft link at __XBinDir__/XDarwinQuartz.
This is typically a soft link to the executable of the XDarwin.app
application. If this fails,
.I XDarwinStartup
will call Launch Services to locate XDarwin.app.
.PP
To start the IOKit X server,
.I XDarwinStartup
will run the XDarwin execuatable, which should be present in the
user's path.
.SH OPTIONS
.I XDarwinStartup
accepts and passes on all options to the X server it
launches. In addition the following options have specific effects:
.TP 8
.B \-iokit
Launch the IOKit X server.
.TP 8
.B \-fullscreen
Launch the Quartz X server to run in full screen mode.
.TP 8
.B \-rootless
Launch the Quartz X server to run in rootless mode.
.TP 8
.B \-quartz
Launch the Quartz X server.
.TP 8
.B \-idle
Pause and do nothing. This option is used by XDarwin.app when it is
started from the Finder.
.SH FILES
.TP 30
__XBinDir__/XDarwin
IOKit mode X server
.TP 30
/Applications/XDarwin.app
Quartz mode X server
.TP 30
__XBinDir__/XDarwinQuartz
Soft link to Quartz mode X server executable
.SH SEE ALSO 
XDarwin(1)
.SH BUGS
The path to XDarwinQuartz should not be hard coded.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

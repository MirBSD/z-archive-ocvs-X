@/* $XFree86: xc/programs/Xserver/hw/darwin/quartz/keysym2ucs.h,v 1.1 2003/11/01 08:13:08 torrey Exp $
 *
 * This module converts keysym values into the corresponding ISO 10646
 * (UCS, Unicode) values.
 *
 * The array keysymtab[] contains pairs of X11 keysym values for graphical
 * characters and the corresponding Unicode value. The function
 * keysym2ucs() maps a keysym onto a Unicode value using a binary search,
 * therefore keysymtab[] must remain SORTED by keysym value.
 *
 * The keysym -> UTF-8 conversion will hopefully one day be provided
 * by Xlib via XmbLookupString() and should ideally not have to be
 * done in X applications. But we are not there yet.
 *
 * We allow to represent any UCS character in the range U-00000000 to
 * U-00FFFFFF by a keysym value in the range 0x01000000 to 0x01ffffff.
 * This admittedly does not cover the entire 31-bit space of UCS, but
 * it does cover all of the characters up to U-10FFFF, which can be
 * represented by UTF-16, and more, and it is very unlikely that higher
 * UCS codes will ever be assigned by ISO. So to get Unicode character
 * U+ABCD you can directly use keysym 0x0100abcd.
 *
 * Author: Markus G. Kuhn <mkuhn@@acm.org>, University of Cambridge, April 2001
 *
 * Special thanks to Richard Verhoeven <river@@win.tue.nl> for preparing
 * an initial draft of the mapping table.
 *
 * This software is in the public domain. Share and enjoy!

@That's what OpenBSD will, probably, ship as XF4 in 3.5
their last sync against XFree86 4.3-current has been
imported into our vendor branch, too

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

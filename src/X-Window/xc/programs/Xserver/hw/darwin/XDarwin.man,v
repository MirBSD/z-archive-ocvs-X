.TH XDARWIN 1 __vendorversion__
.SH NAME
XDarwin \- X window system server for Darwin operating system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B XDarwin
[ options ] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
#ifdef DARWIN_WITH_QUARTZ
.I XDarwin
is the X window server for Mac OS X and the Darwin operating system
provided by the XFree86 Project.
.I XDarwin
can run in three different modes. On Mac OS X,
.I XDarwin
runs in parallel with Aqua in full screen or rootless modes. These modes
are called Quartz modes, named after the Quartz 2D compositing engine used
by Aqua. XDarwin can also be run from the Darwin text console in IOKit mode.
.PP
When running from the console,
.I XDarwin
acts as the window server and uses IOKit services to access the display
framebuffer, mouse and keyboard and to provide a layer of hardware
abstraction. In console mode,
.I XDarwin
will normally be started by the \fIxdm(1)\fP display manager or by a script
that runs the program \fIxinit(1)\fP.
.PP
When running with the Mac OS X Aqua GUI,
.I XDarwin
will normally be started by launching from the Finder, but it may also be
started from the command line with the \fB\-quartz\fP, \fB\-fullscreen\fP, or
\fB\-rootless\fP options. Note that the defaults for various command line
options are set by the
.I XDarwin
application preferences in the Quartz modes.
.PP
In full screen Quartz mode, when the X Window System is active, it takes over
the entire screen. CoreGraphics is used to capture and draw to the screen. The
.I XDarwin
application allows easy switching between the Mac OS X and X window
desktops. More information is available in the Help menu of the
.I XDarwin
application.
.PP
In rootless mode, the X window system and Aqua share your display.  The root
window of the X11 display is the size of the screen and contains all the
other windows. The X11 root window is not displayed in rootless mode as Aqua
handles the desktop background.
#else
.I XDarwin
is the X window server for Mac OS X and the Darwin operating system
provided by the XFree86 Project. This version of
.I XDarwin
can only be started from the Darwin text console. The Mac OS X Aqua GUI, if
present, must be shut down.
.I XDarwin
uses IOKit services to access the display
framebuffer, mouse and keyboard and to provide a layer of hardware
abstraction.
.I XDarwin
will normally be started by the \fIxdm(1)\fP display manager or by a script
that runs the program \fIxinit(1)\fP.
#endif
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
In addition to the normal server options described in the \fIXserver(1)\fP
manual page, \fIXDarwin\fP accepts the following command line switches:
.TP 8
.B \-fakebuttons
Emulates a 3 button mouse using modifier keys. By default, the Command modifier
is used to emulate button 2 and Option is used for button 3. Thus, clicking the
first mouse button while holding down Command will act like clicking
button 2. Holding down Option will simulate button 3.
.TP 8
.B \-nofakebuttons
Do not emulate a 3 button mouse. This is the default.
.TP 8
.B "\-fakemouse2 \fImodifiers\fP"
Change the modifier keys used to emulate the second mouse button. By default,
Command is used to emulate the second button. Any combination of the following
modifier names may be used: Shift, Option, Control, Command, Fn. For example,
.B \-fakemouse2 """Option,Shift""
will set holding Option, Shift and clicking on button one as equivalent to
clicking the second mouse button.
.TP 8
.B "\-fakemouse3 \fImodifiers\fP"
Change the modifier keys used to emulate the third mouse button. By default,
Option is used to emulate the third button. Any combination of the following
modifier names may be used: Shift, Option, Control, Command, Fn. For example,
.B \-fakemouse3 """Control,Shift""
will set holding Control, Shift and clicking on button one as equivalent to
clicking the third mouse button.
.TP 8
.B "\-keymap \fIfile\fP"
On startup \fIXDarwin\fP translates a Darwin keymapping into an X keymap.
The default is to read this keymapping from USA.keymapping. With this option
the keymapping will be read from \fIfile\fP instead. If the file's path is
not specified, it will be searched for in Library/Keyboards/ underneath the
following directories (in order): ~, /, /Network, /System.
.TP 8
.B \-nokeymap
On startup \fIXDarwin\fP translates a Darwin keymapping into an X keymap.
With this option XDarwin queries the kernel for the current keymapping
instead of reading it from a file. This will often fail on newer kernels.
#ifdef DARWIN_WITH_QUARTZ
.TP 8
.B "\-size \fIwidth\fP \fIheight\fP"
Sets the screen resolution for the X server to use.
Ignored in rootless mode.
.TP 8
.B "\-depth \fIdepth\fP"
Specifies the color bit depth to use. Currently only 8, 15, and 24 color bits
per pixel are supported.
Ignored in rootless mode.
.TP 8
.B "\-refresh \fIrate\fP"
Gives the refresh rate to use in Hz. For LCD displays this should be 0.
Ignored in rootless mode.
.TP 8
.B \-fullscreen
Run full screen in parallel with Mac OS X Aqua GUI.
.TP 8
.B \-rootless
Run rootless inside Mac OS X Aqua GUI.
.TP 8
.B \-quartz
Run in parallel with the Mac OS X Aqua GUI using the default mode.
#else
.TP 8
.B "\-size \fIwidth\fP \fIheight\fP"
Sets the screen resolution for the X server to use.
.TP 8
.B "\-depth \fIdepth\fP"
Specifies the color bit depth to use. Currently only 8, 15, and 24 color bits
per pixel are supported.
.TP 8
.B "\-refresh \fIrate\fP"
Gives the refresh rate to use in Hz. For LCD displays this should be 0.
#endif
.TP 8
.B \-showconfig
Print out the server version and patchlevel.
.TP 8
.B \-version
Same as \fB\-showconfig\fP.

.PP
X(__miscmansuffix__), XFree86(1), Xserver(1), xdm(1), xinit(1)
.SH BUGS
.I XDarwin
and this man page still have many limitations. Some of the more obvious
ones are:
.br
- The display mode cannot be changed once the X server has started.
.br
- A screen saver is not supported.
.PP
.SH AUTHORS
XFree86 was originally ported to Mac OS X Server by John Carmack. Dave
Zarzycki used this as the basis of his port of XFree86 4.0 to Darwin 1.0.
Torrey T. Lyons improved and integrated this code into the XFree86
Project's mainline for the 4.0.2 release.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

1.1.1.1
log
@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the
#       C Language, BSD/Berkeley Unix; 386BSD, NetBSD 1.1 and OpenBSD.
#
# Anyone who obtained a copy of this work is hereby permitted to freely use,
# distribute, modify, merge, sublicence, give away or sell it as long as the
# authors are given due credit and the following notice is retained:

# This work is provided "as is", with no explicit or implicit warranty what-
# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-
# butor be held liable for any damage, directly or indirectly, that origina-
# ted through or is caused by creation or modification of this work.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

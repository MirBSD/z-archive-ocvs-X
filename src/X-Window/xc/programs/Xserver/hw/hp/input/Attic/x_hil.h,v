/* MAXHILEVENTS is the maximum number of X events that can
   be put on the events queue as the result of reading a 
   single HIL data packet.  The HIL definition is that 
   a packet may contain one motion event and up to 8 bytes
   of key data.  If the key device is a barcode reader in 
   ASCII mode, we translate each ASCII code into up to 6
   keycodes.  The maximum number of X events that can be 
   generated from a single HIL packet is therefore 49.

   MAX_EVENTS is the size of the server's internal queue of
   input events.  X input is a two-step process, with the 
   first step consisting of reading input events from the 
   device and putting them on this internal queue.  Later
   in the dispatch loop, that queue is emptied and all the
   events are routed by DIX to the appropriate clients.

   The size of the event queue is not as large as the 
   theoretical maximum, but motion events are compressed
   into a single event until a key or button is seen.

   The worst at all reasonable case is alternating key and
   motion data, which would result in less than 50 events.
   A more reasonable guess is 20 events per device.
   Our queue size therefore allows for the worst case on 
   5 - 10 devices simultaneously.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the
#       C Language, BSD/Berkeley Unix; 386BSD, NetBSD 1.1 and OpenBSD.
#
# Anyone who obtained a copy of this work is hereby permitted to freely use,
# distribute, modify, merge, sublicence, give away or sell it as long as the
# authors are given due credit and the following notice is retained:

# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-
# butor be held liable for any damage, directly or indirectly, that origina-
# ted through or is caused by creation or modification of this work.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

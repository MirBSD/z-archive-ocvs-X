# Some sample XFree86 getconfig rules file.

#
# The line below is the getconfig rules file signature, and must be the
# first non-blank, non-comment line.
#

XFree86 Project getconfig rules file.  Version: 1.0

#
# Set the weight for the following rules.  This should be set, otherwise
# the previously set weight will get used, and you have no idea of knowing
# what that might be.
#

$weight = 1000

#
# Rules.  Rules consist of a condition (in perl code) followed by
# a driver name and optionally some additional strings.  The start of a
# rule is indicated by a line with no leading white space.  Subsequent
# lines making up a rule must be indented.  Logical lines may be split
# over multiple physical lines by using the usual continuation '\'.
#
# Rules that are not followed by a driver name may be used to do other
# things, like setting the weight as above.
#

#
# Pre-defined variables include:
#
#   $vendor		PCI vendor ID
#   $device		PCI device ID
#   $revision		PCI revision ID
#   $subsys		PCI subsystem ID
#   $subsysVendor	PCI subsystem vendor ID
#   $class		PCI class
#   $XFree86Version	XFree86 version, as a 'v' string.
#
# The XFree86 version information is also available as the following:
#
#   $XFree86VersionNumeric
#   $XFree86VersionMajor
#   $XFree86VersionMinor
#   $XFree86VersionPatch
#   $XFree86VersionSnap
#   

# Define a fake vendor ID for some sample rules.

$device == $nodevice

# higher.

$weight++ if ($XFree86Version ge v4.3)

$vendor == $novendor
	nodriver
	Option "yy"

# The weight can be changed at any times, and applies to rules that follow
# until changed again.
#

# Example: make the default depth 24 for Radeon R200 and RV200 cards.

@That's what OpenBSD will, probably, ship as XF4 in 3.5
their last sync against XFree86 4.3-current has been
imported into our vendor branch, too

1.1.9.1

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

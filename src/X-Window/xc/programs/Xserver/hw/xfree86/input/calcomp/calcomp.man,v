.SH NAME
calcomp \- Calcomp input driver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B "Section \*qInputDevice\*q"
.BI "  Identifier \*q" idevname \*q
.B  "  Driver \*qcalcomp\*q"
.BI "  Option \*qDevice\*q   \*q" devpath \*q
\ \ ...
.B EndSection
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B calcomp
is an XFree86 input driver for Calcomp devices.
.PP
The
.B calcomp
driver functions as a pointer input device, and may be used as the
X server's core pointer.
.SH SUPPORTED HARDWARE
This driver supports the Calcomp binary format used by the Drawing Board II
and III series.
.SH CONFIGURATION DETAILS
Please refer to XF86Config(__filemansuffix__) for general configuration
details and for options that can be used with all input drivers.  This
section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.
.PP
Both the 3 button stylus and the 4- or 16 button lens cursors can be used
without changing the configuration file. Support for pressure sensitivity
has not been tested, so the solid-tip stylus will probably not work.
.PP
This device supports the following entries:
.RS 8
.TP 4
.B Option \fI"Device"\fP \fI"path"\fP
sets the path to the special file which represents the serial line where
the tablet is plugged. This option is mandatory.
.TP 4
.B Option \fI"Cursor"\fP \fI"Stylus"|"Puck"\fP
this option is supported for backward compatibility only, but it should
not be necessary.
.TP 4
.B Option \fI"DeviceName"\fP \fI"name"\fP
sets the name of the X device. Some user-space programs may require a fixed
name, e.g. TABLET,  to recognize the digitizer.
.TP 4
.B Option \fI"Mode"\fP \fI"Relative"|"Absolute"\fP
sets the mode of the device. Currently only Absolute mode is supported.
.TP 4
.B Option \fI"Pressure"\fP \fI"on"\fP
enables pressure reporting if your tablet supports it. This option is
untested and may not work.
.TP 4
.B Option \fI"AlwaysCore"\fP \fI"on"\fP
enables the sharing of the core pointer. When this feature is enabled, the
device will take control of the core pointer (and thus will emit core events)
and at the same time will be able, when asked so, to report extended events.
.TP 4
.B Option \fI"MinX"\fP \fI"number"\fP
X coordinate of the bottom left corner of the active zone.
.TP 4
.B Option \fI"MinY"\fP \fI"number"\fP
Y coordinate of the bottom left corner of the active zone.
.TP 4
.B Option \fI"MaxX"\fP \fI"Inumber"\fP
X coordinate of the top right corner of the active zone.
.TP 4
.B Option \fI"MaxY"\fP \fI"number"\fP
Y coordinate of the top right corner of the active zone.
.TP 4
.B Option \fI"DebugLevel"\fP \fInumber \fP
sets the level of debugging info reported.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

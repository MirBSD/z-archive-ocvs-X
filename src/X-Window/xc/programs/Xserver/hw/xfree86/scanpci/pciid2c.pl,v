# The basic pci.ids format is:
#   - Vendor lines start with four (lower case) hex digits
#   - Device lines start with one tab followed by four hex digits
#   - Subsystem lines start with two tabs followed by two sets of four
#     hex digits.
#   - Class overrides for devices start with two tabs followed by a "C",
#     followed by four hex digits with the class/subclass value.
#   - Class lines start with a "C".
#   - Comment lines start with a '#'.
#   - Blank lines are ignored.
#
# We allow for extra lines to be appended to modify existing entries or
# add new ones.  To add/modify Device entries without modifying the
# Vendor name, a special vendor name of '"' is used (mnemonic: "ditto").
# Similarly for adding subsystem names without modifying (or adding)
# a corresponding device entry.  To rename an existing entry, simply
# provide the new name.  To remove an existing entry, use the special
# name '-'.

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

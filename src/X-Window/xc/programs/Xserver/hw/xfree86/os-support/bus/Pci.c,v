/*
 * Pci.c - New server PCI access functions
 *
 * The XFree86 server PCI access functions have been reimplemented as a
 * framework that allows each supported platform/OS to have their own
 * platform/OS specific pci driver.
 *
 * All of the public PCI access functions exported to the other parts of
 * the server are declared in Pci.h and defined herein.  These include:
 *	pciInit()              - Initialize PCI access functions
 *	pciFindFirst()         - Find a PCI device by dev/vend id
 *	pciFindNext()          - Find another PCI device by dev/vend id
 *	pciReadLong()          - Read a 32 bit value from a device's cfg space
 *	pciReadWord()          - Read a 16 bit value from a device's cfg space
 *	pciReadByte()          - Read an 8 bit value from a device's cfg space
 *	pciWriteLong()         - Write a 32 bit value to a device's cfg space
 *	pciWriteWord()         - Write a 16 bit value to a device's cfg space
 *	pciWriteByte()         - Write an 8 bit value to a device's cfg space
 *	pciSetBitsLong()       - Write a 32 bit value against a mask
 *	pciSetBitsByte()       - Write an 8 bit value against a mask
 *	pciTag()               - Return tag for a given PCI bus, device, &
 *                               function
 *	pciBusAddrToHostAddr() - Convert a PCI address to a host address
 *	pciHostAddrToBusAddr() - Convert a host address to a PCI address
 *	pciGetBaseSize()       - Returns the number of bits in a PCI base
 *                               addr mapping
 *	xf86MapPciMem()        - Like xf86MapVidMem() except function expects
 *                               a PCI address and a PCITAG that identifies
 *                               a PCI device
 *	xf86ReadPciBIOS()      - Like xf86ReadBIOS() but can handle PCI/host
 *                               address translation and BIOS decode enabling
 *	xf86scanpci()          - Return info about all PCI devices
 *	xf86GetPciDomain()     - Return domain number from a PCITAG
 *	xf86MapDomainMemory()  - Like xf86MapPciMem() but can handle
 *                               domain/host address translation
 *	xf86MapDomainIO()      - Maps PCI I/O spaces
 *	xf86ReadDomainMemory() - Like xf86ReadPciBIOS() but can handle
 *                               domain/host address translation
 *
 * The actual PCI backend driver is selected by the pciInit() function
 * (see below)  using either compile time definitions, run-time checks,
 * or both.
 *
 * Certain generic functions are provided that make the implementation
 * of certain well behaved platforms (e.g. those supporting PCI config
 * mechanism 1 or some thing close to it) very easy.
 *
 * Less well behaved platforms/OS's can roll their own functions.
 *
 * To add support for another platform/OS, add a call to fooPciInit() within
 * pciInit() below under the correct compile time definition or run-time
 * conditional.
 *
 * The fooPciInit() procedure must do three things:
 *	1) Initialize the pciBusTable[] for all primary PCI buses including
 *	   the per domain PCI access functions (readLong, writeLong,
 *	   addrBusToHost, and addrHostToBus).
 *
 *	2) Add entries to pciBusTable[] for configured secondary buses.  This
 *	   step may be skipped if a platform is using the generic findFirst/
 *	   findNext functions because these procedures will automatically
 *	   discover and add secondary buses dynamically.
 *
 *      3) Overide default settings for global PCI access functions if
 *	   required. These include pciFindFirstFP, pciFindNextFP,
 *	   Of course, if you choose not to use one of the generic
 *	   functions, you will need to provide a platform specifc replacement.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright  1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX, the

# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-
# butor be held liable for any damage, directly or indirectly, that origina-

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

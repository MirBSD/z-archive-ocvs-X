 * To map the video memory, we first need to see if we are on a multi-console
 * system. If we are, we need to try to use an existing video class in the
 * kernel. We do this by retrieving the list of currently defined classes
 * (via the new CONS_GETCLASS ioctl()) to see if we have a class that will
 * match the range of memory we desire. If we can't find one, we have an
 * error and we abort.
 *
 * If we are not using a multi-console, we can simply use mmap() to map in
 * the frame buffer, using the classs-access method as a fall-back only if
 * the mmap() fails (it shouldn't). We always set the appropriate pointers
 * in the config structure to point ot the right function to map and unmap
 * the video memory. An alternative to using mmap() is to use the new
 * CONS_ADDVAS call, which will use vasmalloc() and vasbind() in the kernel
 * to map the physical address to a virtual one, which it then returns.
 * I am not 100% sure if this is faster or not, but it may prove easier to
 * debug things. Just to be on the safe side, I have included both methods
 * here, and the mmap() method can be used by setting USE_VASMETHOD to 0

 * CONS_IOPERM ioctl() to grant access only to those ports we care about.
 * This way we can guarantee some small level of stability because a driver
 * does not have access to all ports (which would mean it could play with
 * the PIT and thus affect scheduling times, or a whole slew of other
 * nasty things). However, because XFree86 currently only enables or disables
 * ALL port access, we need to run at IOPL 3, which basically means the
 * X Server runs at the same level as the kernel. You can image why this is
 * unsafe. Oh, and this is not a problem unique to OSR5, other OSes are
 * affected by this as well.
 *
 * So, for the time being, we change our IOPL until such time as the XFree86
 * architecture is changed to allow for tighter control of I/O ports. If and
 * when it is, then the CONS_ADDIOP/DELIOP ioctl() should be used to enable

log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

config DRM
	bool "Direct Rendering Manager (XFree86 4.1.0 and higher DRI support)"
	help
	  Kernel-level support for the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI)
	  introduced in XFree86 4.0. If you say Y here, you need to select
	  the module that's right for your graphics card from the list below.
	  These modules provide support for synchronization, security, and
	  DMA transfers. Please see <http://dri.sourceforge.net/> for more
	  details.  You should also select and configure AGP
	  (/dev/agpgart) support.

config DRM_TDFX
	tristate "3dfx Banshee/Voodoo3+"
	depends on DRM
	help
	  Choose this option if you have a 3dfx Banshee or Voodoo3 (or later),
	  graphics card.  If M is selected, the module will be called tdfx.

config DRM_GAMMA
	tristate "3dlabs GMX 2000"
	depends on DRM
	help
	  This is the old gamma driver, please tell me if it might actually
	  work.

config DRM_R128
	tristate "ATI Rage 128"
	depends on DRM
	help
	  Choose this option if you have an ATI Rage 128 graphics card.  If M
	  is selected, the module will be called r128.  AGP support for
	  this card is strongly suggested (unless you have a PCI version).

config DRM_RADEON
	tristate "ATI Radeon"
	depends on DRM
	help
	  Choose this option if you have an ATI Radeon graphics card.  There
	  are both PCI and AGP versions.  You don't need to choose this to
	  run the Radeon in plain VGA mode.  There is a product page at
	  <http://www.ati.com/na/pages/products/pc/radeon32/index.html>.
	  If M is selected, the module will be called radeon.

config DRM_I810
	tristate "Intel I810"
	depends on DRM && AGP && AGP_INTEL
	help
	  Choose this option if you have an Intel I810 graphics card.  If M is
	  selected, the module will be called i810.  AGP support is required
	  for this driver to work.

config DRM_I830
	tristate "Intel 830M, 845G, 852GM, 855GM, 865G"
	depends on DRM && AGP && AGP_INTEL
	help
	  Choose this option if you have a system that has Intel 830M, 845G,
	  852GM, 855GM or 865G integrated graphics.  If M is selected, the
	  module will be called i830.  AGP support is required for this driver
	  to work.


config DRM_MGA
	tristate "Matrox g200/g400"
	depends on DRM && AGP
	help
	  Choose this option if you have a Matrox G200, G400 or G450 graphics
	  card.  If M is selected, the module will be called mga.  AGP
	  support is required for this driver to work.

config DRM_SIS
	tristate "SiS video cards"
	depends on DRM && AGP
	help
	  Choose this option if you have a SiS 630 or compatible video 
          chipset. If M is selected the module will be called sis. AGP
          support is required for this driver to work.

@That's what OpenBSD will, probably, ship as XF4 in 3.5
their last sync against XFree86 4.3-current has been
imported into our vendor branch, too

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

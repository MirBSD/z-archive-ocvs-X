@Information on files in this directory
--------------------------------------
\xc\programs\xserver\hw\xfree86\os-support\os2

The files in this directory form the OS-dependent porting layer of
XFree86 for OS/2. They are the work of:

       Holger Veit <Holger.Veit@@gmd.de>
       Sebastien Marineau <marineau@@genie.uottawa.ca>

Some functions which were absent from OS/2,
such as direct access to IO ports and the mapping of physical memory,
are implemented in a device-driver written for this purpose by Holger Veit 
<Holger.Veit@@gmd.de>. The driver also implements several functions
necessary for xterm.
The driver should be installed in the config.sys with a line:

DEVICE=path\XF86SUP.SYS

The following gives a brief overview of the implementation of the
porting layer, and lists some of the "gotchas" when modifying the source.

BIOS and physical memory mapping: This is handled by the functions in XF86SUP.SYS driver.

IO permission: Handled by a function in the XF86SUP.SYS driver. Essentially, IO permissions
are granted for the whole Xserver at server initialisation. The device-driver sets the IOPL
level to ring 3 for the Xserver, which in essence gives it the same IO privileges that a
device-driver has. Note the danger here: the Xserver can write to any IO port it wishes,
and can disable interrupts (something which it does), thus can potentially hang the system.

VT switching (switching back and forth to the WPS): This is handled by the keyboard driver,
i.e. the stardard keyboard sequences (CTRL-ESC etc.) trigger the switch back to PM. The 
Xserver is notified of switches by the VIO function VIOSavRedrawWait(), which is run in
a separate thread. When a switch to/from PM is requested, this function call unblocks, and
the Xserver either saves or restores the video buffer and video mode. Note that semaphores
are used to communicate with the main Xserver thread, and handle cases such as server
reset while the server has lost focus etc.
A similar mechanism is used to handle hard-error popups. A thread is run which blocks
on the VIOModeWait() function. When a hard-error notification occurs, the Xserver attempts
to recover by resetting the screen. Note that, due to some (probable) bugs in the OS/2
video drivers, this does not always work as expected. According to the specs, the OS/2
video drivers are supposed to restore the palette when returning from a hard-error. This
does not seem to be always the case..... so the palette in X may be screwed up after the
hard-error.

Keyboard input: because X needs all keyboard event to function (both keypresses, key
releases, for all keys), the keyboard input was implemented by registering a keyboard
monitor for the Xserver. The keyboard monitor is run in a separate thread, and sends
the keystrokes back to the Xserver main thread through a queue. Another thread is
also started, whose purpose is to "eat" the keystrokes returned by KbdCharIn(). Note that 
the monitor was necessary because the OS/2 keyboard driver does not pass all keystrokes
to the application calling KbdCharIn().

Mouse input: This was implemented similarly to the keyboard input: mouse events are
read in a thread, which then passes them to the main Xserver thread through a queue.

Select: this unix and emx function has been reimplemented and optimized for the xserver.
Because of the need to handle input from pipes, sockets, the mouse and keyboard (which
select() in unix does but the EMX select does not), it was decided to rewrite it in
order to minimize CPU usage and maximize responsiveness. Essentially, select() blocks on
a MuxWait semaphore, and unblocks when input is available from pipes, the mouse and the
keyboard. The MuxWait semaphore times out every timeslice, so that sockets can be checked
for activity (unfortunately, sockets are not well-handled in the OS/2 TCPIP and one cannot
attach a semaphore to a socket). There is also the possibility of using the high-resolution
timer (found in Merlin) to check sockets more often than every timeslice.
*** Important: in order to maximize speed, certain shortcuts are utilized in this 
implementation of select(), which makes it unsuitable as a general-purpose function. Also,
it is imperative that the EMX select() never be called from the Xserver! ***


If you wish to modify the source, be aware that there may be very good reasons as
to why certain things were done this way. Usually, if certain function implementations
appear unnecessarily complicated, it is probably because there were subtle problems
with the simpler solutions. Due to the complexity of the Xserver code, and the
differences between OS/2 and unix, there are many potential pitfalls.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@                     Information for Cyrix Chipset Users

                          The XFree86 Project Inc.

                                7 March 2000

1.  Supported hardware

This driver supports a single chipset `mediagx' that should work on the fol-
lowing Cyrix CPUs with integrated graphics:

   o MediaGX

   o MediaGXi

   o MediaGXm

2.  Features

   o Rather sparse (color depth hardcoded to 8)

3.  XF86Config Option

      Option "sw_cursor"
            disable the hardware cursor. (Code not verified yet!)

      Option "no_accel"
            completely disables acceleration. Usually not recommended.

4.  Bugs and Limitations

   o As a first cut at the new design, known problems are everywhere.  The
     console font is corrupted upon exit.  The server seems stable if the
     virtual desktop and resolution size match.  I found 1024x768 usable and
     that's why I released this version.  Geeks can have fun with this but
     NEWBIES should use the 3.3.3.1 release instead!

   o On some older chipsets, the driver may trigger an illegal instruction
     just after probing for the ``scratchpad size''.  If this is the case,
     email to <hecker@@cat.dfrc.nasa.gov> with the output of

          XFree86 -probeonly -verbose

     and this will be fixed.

5.  Authors

   o Richard Hecker <hecker@@cat.dfrc.nasa.gov>

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@That's what OpenBSD will, probably, ship as XF4 in 3.5
their last sync against XFree86 4.3-current has been
imported into our vendor branch, too

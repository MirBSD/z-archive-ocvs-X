@semi-automatic merge and whitespace adjustment of OpenBSD XF4 subtree

@The following is a list of files/directories required when using a
cut-down source tree to build only the X servers.  When using this
cut-down tree, set BuildServersOnly to YES and XnestServer to NO in
xc/config/cf/xf86site.def.

xc/Imakefile
xc/Makefile
xc/Makefile.ini
xc/RELNOTES.TXT
xc/bug-report
xc/config/
xc/include/
xc/lib/Imakefile
xc/lib/X11/
xc/lib/Xau/
xc/lib/Xdmcp/
xc/lib/font/
xc/lib/xtrans/
xc/programs/Imakefile
xc/programs/Xserver/Xserver.man
xc/programs/Xserver/Imakefile

xc/programs/Xserver/cfb16/
xc/programs/Xserver/cfb32/
xc/programs/Xserver/dix/
xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/
xc/programs/Xserver/include/
xc/programs/Xserver/mfb/
xc/programs/Xserver/mi/
xc/programs/Xserver/os/
xc/registry

To include PEX support in the server, the following directory is also required:

xc/programs/Xserver/PEX

To include XIE support in the server, the following directory is also required:

xc/programs/Xserver/XIE


Notes:

1. the Xnest server cannot be built with this cut-down tree since it
requires libX11.

2. To get a cut-down source tree when starting form the full source tree,
do the following:

cd xc
rm -fr doc fonts test util
rm -fr lib/FS lib/ICE lib/PEX5 lib/SM lib/XIE
rm -fr lib/Xaw lib/Xbsd lib/Xext lib/Xi lib/Xmu lib/Xt lib/Xtst lib/oldX
rm -fr programs/[a-z]*
rm -fr programs/Xserver/hw/[a-wy-z]*

3. To start the build, run:

  make World

For some OSs you need to set BOOTSTRAPCFLAGS.  Refer to the appropriate
OS-specific README for information about this.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-
# butor be held liable for any damage, directly or indirectly, that origina-

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

<title>Information for newport Users

<toc>

<sect>Supported Hardware
<p>
This is an unaccelerated driver for the SGI Indy's newport cards. Both the
 8bit and 24bit versions are tested and working.


<sect>Features
<p>
<itemize>
  <item> support for 8 and 24 bit pixel depths
</itemize>

<sect>Notes
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>X -configure does not generate a XF86Config file
  <item>Restoration of the console fails on some variants of the newport
  (Cmap revision C)
  <item>There's only a 1280x1024 mode
</itemize>


<sect>Configuration
<p>
The driver auto-detects all device information necessary to
initialize the card.  The only lines you need in the "Device"
section of your XF86Config file are:
<verb>
       Section "Device"
           Identifier "SGI newport"
           Driver     "newport"
       EndSection
</verb>

However, if you have problems with auto-detection, you can specify:
<itemize>
  <item>bitplanes - number of physical bitplanes (8 or 24)
</itemize>

<sect>Authors

<sect>Acknowledgements

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@That's what OpenBSD will, probably, ship as XF4 in 3.5
their last sync against XFree86 4.3-current has been
imported into our vendor branch, too

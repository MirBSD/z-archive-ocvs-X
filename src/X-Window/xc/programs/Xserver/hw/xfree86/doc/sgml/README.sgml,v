<abstract>

XFree86 is an Open Source version of the X Window System that supports
many UNIX(R) and UNIX-like operating systems (such as Linux, FreeBSD,
NetBSD, OpenBSD and Solaris x86) on Intel and other platforms.  This
version is compatible with X11R6.6.

<toc>

<sect>What is XFree86 &relvers;?
<p>

<![ %updaterel [
XFree86 &relvers; is the &whichupdaterel; update to &fullrelvers;,
the &whichfullrel; full release in the
<![ %earlyrel; [new]]>
XFree86 4.x series.

Update releases are taken from a stable/maintenance branch.  They are
designed to be installed on top of the full release that they are
updating.  They contain fixes for serious problems, most commonly
fixes for security issues, fixes for driver bugs, and fixes that improve
stability.

<![ %fullrel [
XFree86 &relvers; is the &whichfullrel; full release in the
<![ %earlyrel; [new]]>

<![ %snapshot [
XFree86 &relvers; is a pre-release snapshot of XFree86 &fullrelvers;.
<![ %relcandidate [
This snapshot is release candidate &rcnum; for version &fullrelvers;.
]]>
Pre-release snapshots are provided for beta testing.  You should only install
snapshots if you're comfortable dealing with possibly unstable beta-level
software.  If you find problems with this snapshot, you are encouraged
to report your findings to the public XFree86 mailing list:

<p>
XFree86 4.x is the current XFree86 release series.  The first release in
this series was in early 2000.  The core of XFree86 4.x is a modular
X server.
<![ %fullrel [The &relvers; version is a new release that includes
additional hardware support, functional enhancements and bug fixes.]]>
<![ %haverelnotes [
Specific release enhancements can be viewed in the
<htmlurl name="Release Notes" url="RELNOTES.html">.

Most modern PC video hardware is supported in XFree86 &relvers;, and
most PC video hardware that isn't supported explicitly can be used with
the "vesa" driver.  The <htmlurl name="Releaes Notes" url="RELNOTES3.html">
has a table showing the drivers provided with XFree86 &relvers;, and links
to related documentation.

XFree86&trade; is produced by The XFree86 Project, Inc through the work
of a group of volunteer independent developers.  The XFree86 Project is
a non-commercial organisation and XFree86 would not exist without the
invaluable development contributions of volunteers from around the world.
This release is dedicated to the greater XFree86 community, developers
and users alike.

<![ %updaterel; [
The source for version &relvers; is available as a patch relative to
&prevrelvers;.
The patch file is <tt>&prevrelvers;-&relvers;.diff.gz</tt>.

The patch
should be applied to a clean &prevrelvers; source tree, working from
the directory containing the <tt>xc/</tt> directory.  The patch should
be applied by running:

<tscreen><verb>
gzip -d &lt; &prevrelvers;-&relvers;.diff.gz | patch -p0 -E

XFree86-&fullrelvers;-src-5.tgz
XFree86-&fullrelvers;-src-6.tgz
XFree86-&fullrelvers;-src-7.tgz

XFree86 is the Open Source port of X.Org's X11R6.6 release that supports
several UNIX(R) and UNIX-like (such as Linux, the BSDs and Solaris x86)
operating systems on Intel and other platforms.

<p>
XFree86 release 4 is a major re-design of the basic architectural
underpinnings of XFree86's implementation of the original X Consortium's
X Server.  This re-design allows for a modular interaction between the
hardware drivers and the XFree86 core X server.  With 4.x, upgrades to
the X server with new and unsupported hardware can be easily done and
installed without undergoing the previous process of rebuilding an X
server.  All that is required is installing the new driver module and
updating the configuration file.

The road to XFree86 release 4 began as an architectural concept in mid
1997, with the serious framework being implemented in code the beginning
of 1998.  There were several snapshots on the road to 4.0 which are now
part of the 4.0 base release.
<![ %fullrel [The &relvers; version is an upgrade to
&prevrelvers;, which include more hardware ports, code enhancements and
bug fixes.]]>

Release 4 also included the long-awaited integration of the DRI (Direct
Rendering Infrastructure).  This upgrade into the code base  gives
XFree86 the abilities of accelerated direct 3-D graphics rendering, used
widely in games and other visualization programs.

While some driver available in the old 3.3.x release series have not
been converted over to the 4.x series, those required for most modern
video hardware are available.  Please check the <htmlurl name="Driver
Status document" url="Status.html"> first to see whether your hardware
is supported before upgrading to the 4.x series.

<sect>Joining The Team
<sect1> Development
<p>

If you would like to work on the development of XFree86 4, either by
helping with the conversion of our older drivers to the new 4.x design,
or assisting in the addition of new drivers or platforms to the code base
then send a request to <url name="join the XFree86 development team"
url="http://www.xfree86.org:/developer.html">.  This will give you direct
access to the latest XFree86 related development topics and discussions.
Include in your note, your name, email address, reason for joining (what
you will work on) and, level of expertise (coder, DRI, core, specific
driver) and area of interest.

</sect1>


<sect1> Documentation
<p>
If instead your interests are on the Documentation side of the Project,
or you want to contribute and are not ready for plunging into the code,
you can join the Documentation Team (those hardy souls responsible for
the content you are reading :-).  Amongst the Doc Team's activities are
converting our SGML based documentation into an XML based one and updating
and creating technical documentation used by staff and public.  If this
sounds interesting then please send a request to <url name="join the
XFree86 documentation team" url="mailto:signup@@xfree86.org">.
Include in your note, you name, email address, reason for joining (what
you will work on) and level of expertise and whether you are interested
in the tools or content side of the group.

<sect> The Public Mailing Lists
<sect1>  Newbie
<p> 
For those who are new to XFree86  and want to learn more about our
Project we recommend that you join our Newbie list, located at <url name
= "Public Mailing Lists" url = "http://www.xfree86.org/mailman/listinfo">,
where this and other discussions occur with our senior all-volunteer
staff.  This is great forum to get introduced to XFree86 and ask for
help on how to set up the XServer or whether your hardware is supported,
and why not?,  and make suggestions for future releases of XFree86.
This list is supported by our volunteer staff who needs to know how you
are using and interacting with XFree86 and what is wrong and could be
better.  Tell them, they want to know!

If instead you are the lone developer who is improving XFree86 on an
ad hoc basis for your particular environment (I want to get my mouse or
video card to work), and need a specific question asked then you should
go over to our Xpert list where such questions are raised and answered
by our technical development staff.  Remember you do not have to be a
member to write fixes to our code base and if your changes are discrete
and self-contained the volume of developer mail may just be too noisy.


Once your work is finished (coded, debugged and documented) please send
your fix to <email>fixes@@XFree86.org</email>.  This will ensure that
they are included in future releases. And thanks!  You make this truly

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

The source for version &fullrelvers; is split into seven tarballs:

<tt>X&fullsrcvers;src-3.tgz</tt>, <tt>X&fullsrcvers;src-4.tgz</tt>,
<tt>X&fullsrcvers;src-5.tgz</tt>, <tt>X&fullsrcvers;src-6.tgz</tt> and
<tt>X&fullsrcvers;src-7.tgz</tt>.  The first three contain everything
except the fonts and general X11 documentation.  Those three are sufficient
for building XFree86 if you already have a set of fonts.  The fourth
and fifth contain the fonts.  The sixth contains the source for the
general X11 documentation.  The seventh contains the general X11
documentation in hardcopy format.

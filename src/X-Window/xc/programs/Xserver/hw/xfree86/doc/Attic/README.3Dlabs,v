@                    Information for 3DLabs Chipset Users

                          The XFree86 Project Inc.

                                25 June 1999

1.  Supported hardware

This server supports the following 3DLabs chipsets:

   o GLINT 500TX with IBM RGB526 RAMDAC

   o GLINT MX plus Delta with IBM RGB526 and IBM RGB640 RAMDAC

   o GLINT MX plus Gamma with IBM RGB526 and IBM RGB640 RAMDAC

   o Permedia with IBM RGB526 RAMDAC

   o Permedia 2 (classic, 2a, 2v)

2.  Features

   o accelerated

   o hardware cursor

   o DPMS support

   o supported color depths

        o GLINT MX/500TX: 8/16/32 bpp

        o Permedia: 8/16/32 bpp

        o Permedia 2: 8/16/24/32 bpp

3.  XF86Config Option

      Option "sw_cursor"
            disable the hardware cursor.

      Option "no_pixmap_cache"
            disables use of the pixmap cache. Might be useful if drawing
            errors occur.

      Option "no_accel"
            completely disables acceleration. Usually not recommended.

      Option "pci_retry"
            stall the PCI bus while the graphics engine is busy. While this
            might give slightly higher performance, you run the risk of dis-
            turbing other devices that are waiting to be serviced by the pro-
            cessor. This option may cause problems with SCSI cards, serial
            connections, sound cards, etc.

      Option "firegl_3000"
            needed for the Diamond Fire GL 3000 in order to use the primary
            output on that card. The second screen is currently not sup-
            ported.

      Option "overclock_mem"
            Run the memory at a higher clock. Useful on some cards with dis-
            play glitches at higher resolutions. But adds the risk to damage
            the hardware. Use with caution.

4.  Bugs and Limitations

   o The 500TX and MX chipsets cannot switch modes, therefore only the first
     mode on the modes line is available.

   o In some color depths without acceleration there are color problems.

   o While the server is accelerated, there is room for improvement. As our
     development is focusing on XFree86-4.0 we are not planning to change
     that in the 3.3.x branch. XFree86-4.0 will include a significantly
     faster server.

5.  Authors

   o Alan Hourihane <alanh@@fairlite.demon.co.uk>

   o Dirk Hohndel <hohndel@@XFree86.org>

   o Stefan Dirsch <sndirsch@@suse.de>

   o Helmut Fahrion <hf@@suse.de>

   o Special thanks to Elsa AG, Aachen for making it possible for us to
     develop this server and furnishing us with plenty of boards and informa-
     tion to help us on the way

   o Very special thanks to SuSE GmbH, Nuernberg for allowing some of us to
     work on this server on paid time, thereby financing development of this
     server.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

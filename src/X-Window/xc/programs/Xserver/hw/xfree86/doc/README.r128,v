@                     Information for ATI Rage 128 Users

                     Precision Insight, Inc., SuSE GmbH

                                13 June 2000

1.  Supported Hardware

   o ATI Rage 128 based cards

2.  Features

   o Full support (including hardware accelerated 2D drawing) for 8, 15, 16,
     24 bit pixel depths.

   o Hardware cursor support to reduce sprite flicker.

   o Support for high resolution video modes up to 1800x1440 @@ 70Hz.

   o Support for doublescan video modes (e.g., 320x200 and 320x240).

   o Support for gamma correction at all pixel depths.

   o Fully programmable clock supported.

   o Robust text mode restore for VT switching.

3.  Technical Notes

   o None

4.  Reported Working Video Cards

   o Rage Fury AGP 32MB

   o XPERT 128 AGP 16MB

   o XPERT 99 AGP 8MB

5.  Configuration

The driver auto-detects all device information necessary to initialize the
card.  The only lines you need in the "Device" section of your XF86Config
file are:

            Section "Device"
                Identifier "Rage 128"
                Driver     "r128"
            EndSection

or let xf86config do this for you.

However, if you have problems with auto-detection, you can specify:

   o VideoRam - in kilobytes

   o MemBase  - physical address of the linear framebuffer

   o IOBase   - physical address of the memory mapped IO registers

   o ChipID   - PCI DEVICE ID

6.  Driver Options

   o "hw_cursor" - request hardware cursor (default)

   o "sw_cursor" - software cursor only

   o "no_accel"  - software rendering only

   o "dac_8_bit" - use color weight 888 in 8 bpp mode (default)

   o "dac_6_bit" - use color weight 666 in 8 bpp mode (VGA emulation)

7.  Known Limitations

   o None

8.  Authors

The XFree86 4 driver was ported from XFree86 3.3.x and enhanced by:

   o Rickard E. (Rik) Faith <faith@@precisioninsight.com>

   o Kevin E. Martin <kevin@@precisioninsight.com>

The XFree86 4 driver was funded by ATI and was donated to The XFree86 Project
by:

         Precision Insight, Inc.
         Cedar Park, TX
         USA

The XFree86 3.3.x driver used for the port was written by:

   o Rickard E. (Rik) Faith <faith@@precisioninsight.com>

   o Kevin E. Martin <kevin@@precisioninsight.com>

The XFree86 3.3.x driver was funded by ATI and was donated to The XFree86
Project by Precision Insight, Inc.  It was based in part on an earlier driver
that was written by:

   o Alan Hourihane <alanh@@fairlite.demon.co.uk>

   o Dirk Hohndel <hohndel@@suse.de>

This early driver was funded and donated to The XFree86 Project by:

         SuSE GmbH
         Schanzaekerstr. 10
         90443 Nuernberg
         Germany

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2

@That's what OpenBSD will, probably, ship as XF4 in 3.5
their last sync against XFree86 4.3-current has been
imported into our vendor branch, too

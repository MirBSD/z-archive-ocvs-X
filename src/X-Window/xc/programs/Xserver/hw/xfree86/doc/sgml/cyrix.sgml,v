<title>Information for Cyrix Chipset Users

<toc>

<sect>Supported hardware <p>

This driver
supports a single chipset `mediagx' that should work on the following Cyrix
CPUs with integrated graphics:

<itemize>
<item>MediaGX
<item>MediaGXi
<item>MediaGXm
</itemize>

<sect>Features <p>
<itemize>
<item>Rather sparse (color depth hardcoded to 8)
</itemize>

<sect>XF86Config Option <p>
<descrip>
<tag>Option "sw_cursor"</tag>
disable the hardware cursor. (Code not verified yet!)
<tag>Option "no_accel"</tag>
completely disables acceleration. Usually not recommended.
</descrip>

<sect>Bugs and Limitations<p>
<itemize>
<item>As a first cut at the new design, known problems are everywhere.
The console font is corrupted upon exit.  The server seems stable if
the virtual desktop and resolution size match.  I found 1024x768 usable
and that's why I released this version.  Geeks can have fun with this
but NEWBIES should use the 3.3.3.1 release instead!
<item>On some older chipsets, the driver may trigger an illegal instruction
just after probing for the ``scratchpad size''.  If this is the case,
email to <email>hecker@@cat.dfrc.nasa.gov</email> with the output of 
<verb>
XFree86 -probeonly -verbose
</verb>
and this will be fixed.
</itemize>

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

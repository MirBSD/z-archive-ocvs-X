<title>Release Notes for XFree86&trade; &relvers;
<author>The XFree86 Project, Inc
<date>29 February 2004

<abstract>

This document contains information about features and their status  in XFree86
&relvers;.

</abstract>

<toc>

<p>

<sect>Introduction to the 4.x Release Series
<p>
XFree86 4.0 was the first official release of the new XFree86 4 series.
<![ %updaterel [
XFree86 &relvers; is the &whichupdaterel; update to &fullrelvers;, which
is the latest full release in that series.
]]>
<![ %fullrel [
The current release (&relvers;) is the latest in that series.
]]>
XFree86
4 represents a significant redesign of the XFree86 X server.  Not all
of the hardware drivers from 3.3.x have been ported to 4.x yet, but
conversely, 4.x has support for a lot of hardware that is not supported
in 3.3.x.  Our <htmlurl name="Driver Status document" url="Status.html">
summarizes how the hardware driver support compares between &legacyvers;
and &relvers;.  

XFree86 4.4 introduces an automatic configuration mechanism for the
XFree86 server which makes it now possible to start XFree86 without first
creating a configuration file.  The initial automatic configuration
support is targeted towards Linux and FreeBSD and it is hoped that
automatic configuration will be supported on other platforms in
future releases. 

If you are running either  Linux or FreeBSD, try it out if you
do not already have a working <tt>XF86Config</tt> file.  If you want to
customise things afterwards, you can cut and paste the automatically
generated configuration from the <tt>/var/log/XFree86.0.log</tt> file
into an <tt>XF86Config</tt> file and make your customisations there.

If you do not have any luck with automatic configuration, or you are using
a platform that is not currently supported, try one of the older methods
for getting started.

XFree86 comes with a graphical configuration tool called "<tt>xf86cfg</tt>",
which also has a text mode interface and can be used to create an initial
configuration file. It can also be used to customise existing
configurations.

Next in the order of configuration preferences is to use the XFree86
server's ability to create a starting configuration file.  Run as root:

<tscreen><verb>
XFree86 -configure
</verb></tscreen>

and follow the instructions.

Finally, if all else fails, the trusty old standby text-based tool
"<tt>xf86config</tt>" can also be used for generating X server config
files.

At least one, and hopefully, all of these configuration options will
give you a reasonable starting point for a suitable configuration
file.  With the automatic mechanism you might even find that you don't
need one!  

If you do need to customise the configuration file, see the <htmlurl
name="XF86Config manual page" url="XF86Config.5.html">.  You can also
check the driver-specific manual pages and the related documentation
(found at <ref id="drivertables" name="tables below"> also.

Before downloading  the binary distributions for this release, please
have a quick read through the <htmlurl name="Installation Document"
url="Install.html">.  It may save you some time and also help you figure out
which of the binary releases you need.

<![ %updaterel [
The next sections describe what has changed in the update release(s)
as well as what is new in the latest full release (&fullrelvers;).
]]>
<![ %fullrel [
The next section describes what is new in the latest version (&relvers;)
compared with the previous full release (&prevfullrelvers).
]]>
The other sections below describe some of the new features and changes
between 3.3.x and 4.0.  There are lot's of new features, and we definitely
don't have enough space to cover them all here.

<sect>Summary of new features in &fullrelvers;.
<p>

This is a sampling of the new features in XFree86 &fullrelvers;.  A more
complete list of changes can be found in the CHANGELOG that is part of
the XFree86 source tree.  It can also be viewed online at our <url
name="CVSweb server"
url="http://cvsweb.xfree86.org/cvsweb/xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/CHANGELOG?rev=HEAD">.

<sect1>Video Driver Enhancements

<p>
<itemize>
<item>Several stability issues with the support for the Intel 830M,
	845G, 852GM, 855GM and 865G integrated graphics chipsets have been
	fixed.  Some limitations related to the driver's use of the video
	BIOS remain, especially for some laptops.

<item>The nv driver for NVIDIA cards has been updated as follows:

	<itemize>
	<item>Support added to the nv driver for the GeForce FX 5700,
		which didn't work with XFree86 4.3.

	<item>The driver now does a much better job of auto-detecting
		which connector of dual output cards the monitor is
		attached to, and this should reduce or eliminate the
		need for manual XF86Config overrides.

	<item>The 2D acceleration for TNT and GeForce has been completely
		rewritten and its performance should be substantially
		improved.

	<item>TNT and GeForce cards have a new Xv PutImage adaptor which
		does scaled YUV bit blits.

	</itemize>

<item>The SiS driver has seen major updates, including:

	<itemize>
	<item>Support for 661/741/760 and support for 330 (Xabre).

	<item>Merged Framebuffer mode.

	<item>Support for DVI, and much more.

	<item>DRI for 300 series (300/305, 540, 630, 730) is supported
		again.

	</itemize>

<item>A new driver for several VIA integrated graphics chipsets has been added.

<item>Various updates and bug fixes have been made to most other drivers.

</itemize>

<sect1>Input Driver Enhancements

<p>
<itemize>
<item>The mouse driver has some support on Linux and FreeBSD for
	auto-detecting which device node to use. This makes it unnecessary
	to supply this information in the XF86Config file in most cases.

</itemize>

<sect1>IPv6 support
<p>
XFree86 4.4 supports IPv6, based on the code contributed by Sun
Microsystems, Inc. to X.Org. See <url name="X.org's document"
url="http://www.x.org/IPV6_Specific_Changes.html"> for a detailed list
of what these changes are and how your system is affected by them.

<sect2>Protocol names and aliases. 
<p>
<itemize>
<item>tcp is an alias for both IPv6 and IPv4 transports.
<item>inet specifies IPv4 only. 
<item>inet6 specifies IPv6 only.
</itemize>
<p>
You can force the X server to only listen to IPv4 connections with the
<tt>X -nolisten inet6 </tt> command or you can force a IPv6 connection
by setting <bf>DISPLAY</bf> to <tt>inet6/host:0</tt>.

<sect2>XDM
<p>
The IPv6 XDMCP code is not enabled by default on platforms that don't 
support binding a IPv6 socket to a IPv4 address. 
<p>
The XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 authentication scheme does not support IPv6
addresses but a new release of the protocol, XDM-AUTHORIZATION-2 has
been designed; this though is yet to be  implemented.  By default XFree86
builds do not enable the XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 code.


<sect1>X Server and Extension Updates

<p>
<itemize>

<item>The Mesa version used for OpenGL&reg; 1.3 and DRI driver support
	has been updated to 5.0.2.

</itemize>

<sect1>Client and Library Updates

<p>
<sect2>Xterm
<p>

The user-visible changes to xterm since XFree86 4.3 are:

	Bug Fixes:
	<itemize>
	<item>Make signalInhibit resource work, i.e., disable the menu
		entries that would send signals to, or exit xterm.

	<item>Make cursor definition in tek4014 emulation work as originally
		implemented.

	<item>Modify translations for scrollbar so that one can use
		shifted pageup, wheel mouse, etc., while the mouse
		pointer is over the scrollbar.

	<item>Correct initialization of G1 character set mapping.

	</itemize>

	New Features:
	<itemize>
	<item>Modify the predictable version of the generated logfile
		name to append the process-id rather than a random value.

	<item>Modify scroll-back and scroll-forw actions to accept an
		adjustment value, e.g.,

		<tscreen><verb>
scroll-back(1, page-2)
		</verb></tscreen>

		to scroll back by 2 lines less than a page.
		
	<item>Add visualBellDelay resource to modify the length of
		time used for visual bell, for very slow displays or
		very fast computers.

	</itemize>

	Improved Locale Support:
	<itemize>
	<item>modify uxterm script to strip modifiers such as "@@euro" from the
		locale setting before adding ".UTF-8".

	<item>Add logic to wide-character support which attempts to
		load fonts specified by utf8Fonts subresources at startup.
		The subresources have the same names as the fonts which
		they replace, e.g., font, font1, etc., so that the
		ISO-10646-1 fonts can be specified in the XTerm
		app-defaults file.

	<item>Improved performance with chinput application.

	</itemize>

	Improved Font Handling:
	<itemize>
	<item>Document in xterm's manual page how to use XFree86 ":unscaled"
		keyword to suppress scaling of bold fonts.

	<item>Improved logic for deriving bold fontname from normal
		fontname.

	<item>Make double-width characters work with -u8 option.

	<item>Updated table of Unicode line-drawing characters.

	<item>Several fixes for rendering using Xft (option -fa):
		<itemize>
		<item>Make height of TrueType fonts match ascent+descent.

		<item>Translate Unicode values (from UTF-8 output to
			xterm) for line-drawing to xterm's internal
			code, etc., since TrueType fonts generally do
			not have either set of line-drawing glyphs.
			xterm can draw these directly.

		<item>Pass 16-bit values rather than 8-bit values to
			xtermXftDrawString() to allow for wide-characters.

		<item>Use built-in line-drawing characters for Xft fonts.

		<item>Implement underlining.
		</itemize>

	<item>Implement boldMode for wide-characters.

	<item>Modified to work with CJK double-width (bi-width/monospace)
		fonts.

	</itemize>

	Workarounds for Special Applications:
	<itemize>
	<item>Add option -k8 and resource allowC1Printable to allow
		users of non-VTxxx character sets such as KOI-8 to treat
		the C1 control area (character codes 128-159) as printable
		rather than control characters.

	<item>Add configure option --enable-broken-st and resource
		brokenStringTerm to allow user to revert one part of
		the parsing table corrections.

	<item>Add configure option --enable-broken-osc and resource
		brokenLinuxOSC to accommodate scripts which do not
		distinguish between running in the Linux console and
		running in X.  Linux console recognizes malformed control
		strings which start with an OSC, but are fixed-length,
		with no terminator.

	<item>Add configure option --enable-pty-handshake to allow
		one to compile-in support for the pty handshaking logic,
		and resource ptyHandshake to enable or disable it.  This
		feature is normally enabled.

	</itemize>

	Modified Resources:
	<itemize>
	<item>Change color4 to "dodger blue", since this provides
		better contrast.

	<item>Remove color resources from XTerm.ad, leaving them only
		in XTerm-col.ad

	<item>Modify UXTerm.ad resource file to include "XTerm-color"
		rather than "XTerm", in case the latter file contains
		no color resource definitions.

	<item>Changed class of veryBoldColors to VeryBoldColors, since
		ColorMode is associated with boolean resources.

	<item>Changed classes of colorBDMode and similar resources
		that override colors when a video attribute is set to
		ColorAttrMode, to make them distinct from ColorMode.
		This avoids an unexpected rendering of reverse video,
		for example.

	</itemize>

	Modified terminfo/termcap entries:
	<itemize>
	<item>Add indp and rin to terminfo entry.

	<item>Add le to termcap xterm-basic entry.  Though missing
		from older termcaps for xterm, some applications check
		for it.

	<item>Correct AF/AB strings in termcap for xterm-256color and
		xterm-88color entries.

	</itemize>

<sect1>I18N and Font Updates

<p>
<itemize>
<item>FreeType2 updated to version 2.1.4.

<item>The "freetype" X server font backend has been updated by the
	<url name="After X-TT Project" url="http://x-tt.sourceforge.jp/"> to
	include the functionality previously provided by the "xtt" backend,
	and to fix some bugs.  The "xtt" backend will be dropped in the
	next release in favour of the updated unified "freetype" backend.

	<itemize>
	<item>The new "freetype" backend has the improved "very lazy" metric
		calculation method which enables super-fast loading of
		proportional CJKV fonts.

	<item>All of the servers, including xfs, Xnest, Xprt, Xvfb, the
		Cygwin-XFree86 server (as well as the XFree86 server)
		can handle the perfect TTCap options.

	</itemize>

<item>The Compose file processing mechanism has been improved and made
	more flexible.  See the <ref id="compose" name="Xlib Compose
	file support and extensions section below">.

<item>The Bitstream Vera TrueType fonts that Bitstream, Inc donated to
	the GNOME Foundation have been included with this release.

</itemize>

<sect1>OS Support Updates

<p>
<itemize>
<item>On Mac OS X, the appropriate backend drawing code is now dynamically
	loaded at runtime which reduces the X server's memory footprint.
	In rootless mode, Apple's Xplugin library is used where available.
	(Xplugin is included as part of Mac OS X on Panther.) With Xplugin,
	XDarwin provides identical performance to Apple's X11, including
	the following improvements over 4.3:
	<itemize>
	<item>Added direct GLX rendering with thread support.
	<item>Faster 2-D drawing.
	<item>Added support for the Apple-WM extension so XDarwin interoperates
		with quartz-wm.
	</itemize>

<item>On Darwin, IOKit mode now uses shadowfb for much faster drawing.

<item>Various GNU/Hurd support updates.

<item>Experimental support added for GNU/KFreeBSD and GNU/KNetBSD systems.

<item>SCO OpenServer support updates.  XFree86 4.4 now works on Release
5.0.7 with Maintenance Pack 1, or on prior releases through Release
5.0.4.  Please consult the <htmlurl name="README.SCO" url="SCO.html">
file for details.

</itemize>

<sect>Known Problems
<p>

<itemize>
<item>Known issues with this version of the SiS driver:

	<itemize>
	<item>The driver will not work with upcoming laptops/notebooks
	with 661/741/760 and 30xLV bridges as regards LCD output. This
	is due folks at SiS at the very moment writing an entirely new
	VBIOS for such machines whose data layout is not decided yet.
	(This might affect machines with 650/740 as well within the next
	year.)

	<item>Xv does not work correctly in TV NTSC 1024x768 mode, if
	the overlay is very large (or full screen). The effect are
	flickering lines on the screen. This is a hardware problem. Do
	not use this mode for video.

	<item>YPbPr 720p output is blurry (at least at 1024x768; unknown
	for other modes). This is a driver problem; solution currently
	unknown.

	</itemize>

<item>We have received a late report that enabling DPMS support with
the radeon driver can damage some Viewsonic monitors.  DPMS is usually
disabled by default.  You can verify whether or not DPMS is enabled by
running 'xset q' from within your X session.

</itemize>

<sect>Overview of XFree86 4.x.
<p>
XFree86 4.x has a single X server binary called <tt>XFree86</tt>.  This
binary can either have one or more video and input drivers linked in
statically, or more usually, dynamically, and in that manner load the
video drivers, input drivers, and other modules that are needed.

XFree86 &relvers; has X server support for most UNIX&reg; and UNIX-like
operating systems on Intel/x86 platforms, plus support for Linux and
some BSD OSs on Alpha, PowerPC, IA-64, AMD64, Sparc, and Mips platforms,
and for Darwin on PowerPC.  Support for additional architectures
and operating systems is in progress and is planned for future releases.

<sect1>Loader and Modules
<p>
The XFree86 X server has a built-in run-time loader, which can load
normal object files and libraries in most of the commonly used formats.
The loader does not rely on an operating system's native dynamic
loader support and it works on platforms that do not provide this feature.
This  allows  for the modules to be operating system independent (although
not, of course, CPU architecture independent) which means that a module
compiled on Linux/x86 can be loaded by an X server running on Solaris/x86,
or FreeBSD, or even OS/2.

A main benefit of this, is that when modules are updated, they do not
need to be recompiled for every different operating system.  The loader
in version &relvers; has support for Intel (x86), Alpha and PowerPC
platforms.  It also has preliminary support for Sparc platforms.

The X server makes use of modules for video drivers, X server extensions,
font rasterisers, input device drivers, framebuffer layers (like mfb,
cfb, etc), and internal components used by some drivers (like XAA),

The module interfaces (both API and ABI) used in this release are subject
to change without notice.  While we will attempt to provide backward
compatibility for the module interfaces as of the 4.0 release (meaning
that 4.0 modules will work with future core X server binaries), we cannot
guarantee this.  Compatibility in the other direction is explicitly
not guaranteed because new modules may rely on interfaces added in new
releases.

<bf>Note about module security</bf>
<quote><p>
	The XFree86 X server runs with root privileges, i.e. 
	the X server loadable modules also run with these privileges.
	For this reason we recommend that all users be careful to only
	use loadable modules from reliable sources,  otherwise the
	introduction of viruses and contaminated code can occur and
	wreak havoc on your system.  We hope to have a mechanism for
	signing/verifying the modules that we provide available in a
	future release.

</quote>

<sect1>Configuration File <label id="config">
<p>

The XFree86 server uses a configuration file as the primary mechanism
for providing configuration and run-time parameters.  The configuration
file format is described in detail in the <htmlurl name="XF86Config(5)"
url="XF86Config.5.html"> manual page.

The XFree86 server has support for automatically determining an initial
configuration on most platforms, as well as support or generating a basic
initial configuration file.

<sect1>Command Line Options
<p>

Command line options can be used to override some default parameters and
parameters provided in the configuration file.  These command line options
are described in the <htmlurl name="XFree86(1)"
url="XFree86.1.html"> manual page.
  
<sect1>XAA
<p>

The XFree86 Acceleration Architecture (XAA) was completely rewritten
from scratch for XFree86 4.x.  Most drivers implement acceleration by
making use of the XAA module.

<sect1>Multi-head
<p>
Some multi-head configurations are supported in XFree86 4.x, primarily
with multiple PCI/AGP cards.

One of the main problems is with drivers not sufficiently initialising
cards that were not initialised at boot time.  This has been improved
somewhat with the INT10 support that is used by most drivers (which
allows secondary card to be "soft-booted", but in some cases there are
other issues that still need to be resolved.  Some combinations can be
made to work better by changing which card is the primary card (either
by using a different PCI slot, or by changing the system BIOS's preference
for the primary card).

<sect1>Xinerama
<p>
Xinerama is an X server extension that allows multiple physical screens
to behave as a single screen.  With traditional multi-head in X11,
windows cannot span or cross physical screens.  Xinerama removes this
limitation.  Xinerama does, however, require that the physical screens
all have the same root depth, so it isn't possible, for example, to use
an 8-bit screen together with a 16-bit screen in Xinerama mode.

Xinerama is not enabled by default, and can be enabled with the
<tt>+xinerama</tt> command line option for the X server.

Xinerama was included with X11R6.4.  The version included in XFree86 4.x
was completely rewritten for improved performance and correctness.

Known problems:
<itemize>
  <item>Most window managers are not Xinerama-aware, and so some
	operations like window placement and resizing might not behave
	in an ideal way.  This is an issue that needs to be dealt with
	in the individual window managers, and isn't specifically an
	XFree86 problem.

</itemize>

<sect1>DGA version 2
<p>

DGA 2.0 is included in &relvers;.
Documentation for the client libraries can be found in the <htmlurl
name="XDGA(3)" url="XDGA.3.man"> man page.  A good degree of backwards
compatibility with version 1.0 is provided.


<sect1>DDC
<p>
The VESA&reg; Display Data Channel (DDC&trade;) standard allows the monitor
to tell the video card (or on some cases the computer directly) about
itself; particularly the supported screen resolutions and refresh rates.

Partial or complete DDC support is available in most of the video drivers.
DDC is enabled by default, but can be disabled with a "Device" section
entry:  <tt>Option "NoDDC"</tt>.  We have support for DDC versions 1
and 2; these can be disabled independently with <tt>Option "NoDDC1"</tt>
and <tt>Option "NoDDC2"</tt>.

At startup the server prints out DDC information from the display, and
can use this information to set the default monitor parameters, or to
warn about monitor sync limits if those provided in the configuration file
don't match those that are detected.

<sect2>Changed behavior caused by DDC.
<p>
Several drivers uses DDC information to
set the screen size and pitch.  This can be overridden by explicitly
resetting it to the and non-DDC default value 75 with the <tt>-dpi
75</tt> command line option for the X server, or by specifying appropriate
screen dimensions with the "DisplaySize" keyword in the "Monitor" section
of the config file.


<sect1>GLX and the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI)
<p>

Direct rendered OpenGL&reg; support is provided for several hardware
platforms by the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI).  Further information
about DRI can be found at the <url name="DRI Project's web site"
url="http://dri.sf.net/">.  The 3D core rendering component is provided by
<url name="Mesa" url="http://www.mesa3d.org">.

<sect1>XVideo Extension (Xv)
<p>

The XVideo extension is supported in XFree86 4.x.
An XvQueryPortAttributes function has been added as well as
support for XvImages.  XvImages are XImages in alternate color spaces 
such as YUV and can be passed to the server through shared memory
segments.  This allows clients to display YUV data with high quality
hardware scaling and filtering.

<sect1>X Rendering Extension (Render) <label id="render">
<p>

The X Rendering extension provides a 2D rendering model that more
closely matches application demands and hardware capabilities.  It provides
a rendering model derived from Plan 9 based on Porter/Duff image
composition rather than binary raster operations.

<p>
Using simple compositing operators provided by most hardware, Render
can draw anti-aliased text and geometric objects as well as perform 
translucent image overlays and other image operations not possible with 
the core X rendering system.

<p>
XFree86 &relvers; provides a partial implementation of Render sufficient 
for drawing anti-aliased text and image composition.  Still to be 
implemented are geometric primitives and affine transformation of images.

<p>
Unlike the core protocol, Render provides no font support for applications,
rather it allows applications to upload glyphs for display on the screen.
This allows the client greater control over text rendering and complete
access to the available font information while still providing hardware
acceleration.  The Xft library provides font access for
Render applications.

<sect2>The Xft Library
<p>

On the client side, the Xft library provides access to fonts for
applications using the FreeType library, version 2.  FreeType currently
supports Type1 and TrueType font files, a future release is expected to 
support BDF and PCF files as well, so Render applications will have access 
to the complete range of fonts available to core applications.  One 
important thing to note is that Xft uses the vertical size of the monitor 
to compute accurate pixel sizes for provided point sizes; if your monitor 
doesn't provide accurate information via DDC, you may want to add that 
information to <tt>XF86Config</tt>.

<p>

To allow a graceful transition for applications moving from core text
rendering to the Render extension, Xft can use either core fonts or FreeType
and the Render extension for text.  By default, Xft is configured to support
both core fonts and FreeType fonts using the supplied version of FreeType
2.  See the section on FreeType support in Xft for instructions on
configuring XFree86 to use an existing FreeType installation.

<p>
The Xft library uses a configuration file, <tt>XftConfig</tt>, which
contains information about which directories contain font files and also
provides a sophisticated font aliasing mechanism.  Documentation for that
file is included in the <htmlurl name="Xft(3)" url="Xft.3.man"> man page.

</sect2>
<sect2>FreeType support in Xft
<p>

XFree86 &relvers; includes sources for FreeType version 2.1.4, and, by
default, they are built and installed automatically.

</sect2>

<sect2>Application Support For Anti-Aliased Text
<p>

Only three applications have been modified in XFree86 &relvers; to work 
with the Render extension and the Xft and FreeType libraries to provide 
anti-aliased text.  Xterm, xditview and x11perf.  Migration of other 
applications may occur in future releases.

<p>
By default, xterm uses core fonts through the standard core API.  It has
a command line option and associated resource to direct it to use
Xft instead:
<itemize>
  <item><tt>-fa</tt> family / <tt>.VT100.faceName:</tt> family.  Selects the 
	font family to use.
</itemize>

<p>
Xditview will use Xft instead of the core API by default.  X11perf 
includes tests to measure the performance of text rendered in three ways, 
anti-aliased, anti-aliased with sub-pixel sampling and regular chunky 
text, but through the Render extension, a path which is currently somewhat
slower than core text.
</sect2>

<sect1>Other extensions
<p>

The XFree86-Misc extension has not been fully ported to the new server
architecture yet.  This should be completed in a future release.

The XFree86-VidModeExtension extension has been updated, and mostly ported
to the new server architecture.  The area of mode validation needs further
work, and the extension should be used with care.  This extension has
support for changing the gamma setting at run-time, for modes where this
is possible.  The <tt>xgamma</tt> utility makes use of this feature.
Compatibility with the 3.3.x version of the extension is provided.
The missing parts of this extension and some new features should be
completed in a future release.

<sect1>xedit
<p>

Xedit has several new features, including:
<itemize>
  <item>An embedded lisp interpreter that allows easier extension of the editor.
  <item>Several new syntax highlight modes, and indentation rules for C and Lisp.
  <item>Flexible search/replace interface that allows regex matches.

<!--
<sect>Fonts and Internationalisation
<p>
-->

<sect1>Font support
<p>

Details about the font support in XFree86 4.x can be found
in the <htmlurl name="README.fonts" url="fonts.html"> document.

<sect1>TrueType support
<p>

XFree86 4.x comes with two TrueType backends, known as
"FreeType" backend (the <tt>"freetype"</tt> module) and `X-TrueType'
(the <tt>"xtt"</tt> module).  Both of these backends are based on the
FreeType library.  The functionality of X-TrueType has been merged into
the FreeType backend by the After X-TT Project for XFree86 4.4.
Consequently, the old X-TrueType backend will be dropped as of XFree86
4.5.

<sect1>CID font support
<p>

Support for CID-keyed fonts is included in XFree86 4.x.
The CID-keyed font format was designed by <url name="Adobe Systems"
url="http://www.adobe.com"> for fonts with large character sets.  The
CID-keyed font support in XFree86 was donated by <url name="SGI"
url="http://www.sgi.com">.  See the <htmlurl name="LICENSE"
url="LICENSE.html"> document for a copy of the CID Font Code Public
License.

<sect1>Internationalisation of the scalable font backends
<p>

XFree86 4.x has a ``fontenc'' layer to allow the scalable font backends
to use a common method of font re-encoding.  This re-encoding makes it
possible to uses fonts in encodings other than their their native
encoding.  This layer is used by the Type1 and Speedo backends and the
`xfsft' version of the TrueType backend.  The `X-TrueType' version of
the TrueType backend uses a different re-encoding method based on loadable
encoding modules.

<sect1>Large font optimisation
<p>

The glyph metrics array, which all the X clients using a particular font
have access to, is placed in shared memory, so as to reduce redundant
memory consumption.  For non-local clients, the glyph metrics array is
transmitted in a compressed format.

<sect1>Unicode/ISO 10646 support
<p>
What is included in 4.x:

<itemize>
  <item>All ``-misc-fixed-*'' BDF fonts are now available in the
        ISO10646-1 encoding and cover at least the 614 characters
        found in ISO 8859-{1-5,7-10,14,15}, CP1252, and MES-1. The
        non-bold fonts also cover all Windows Glyph List 4 (WGL4)
        characters, including those found in all 8-bit MS-DOS/Windows
        code pages. The 8-bit variants of the ``-misc-fixed-*'' BDF
        fonts (ISO8859-1, ISO8859-2, KOI8-R, etc.) have all been
        automatically generated from the new ISO10646-1 master fonts.

  <item>Some ``-misc-fixed-*'' BDF ISO10646-1 fonts now cover a
        comprehensive Unicode repertoire of over 3000 characters
        including all Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Armenian, Gregorian,
        Hebrew, IPA, and APL characters, plus numerous scientific,
	typographic, technical, and backwards-compatibility
        symbols. Some of these fonts also cover Arabic, Ethiopian,
        Thai, Han/Kanji, Hangul, full ISO 8859, and more. For the 6x13
        font there is now a 12x13ja Kanji extension and for the 9x18
        font there is a 18x18ja Kanji/Han/Hangul extension, which
        covers all ISO-2022-JP-2 (RFC 1554) characters. The 9x18 font
        can also be used to implement simple combining characters by
        accent overstriking. For more information, read Markus Kuhn's
        <url name="UTF-8 and Unicode FAQ"
        url="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html">.

  <item>Mark Leisher's ClearlyU proportional font (similar to Computer
	Modern).

  <item>ISO 10646/Unicode UTF-8 Level 1 support added to xterm
	(enabled with the <tt>-u8</tt> option).

  <item>Both the xfsft (the <tt>"freetype"</tt> module) and the X-TrueType
	(the <tt>"xtt"</tt> module) TrueType font backends support
	Unicode-encoded fonts.

</itemize>

<sect1>Xlib Compose file support and extensions <label id="compose">
<p>

A more flexible Compose file processing system was added to Xlib in
XFree86 4.4.0.  The compose file is searched for in the following order:

<enum>
<item>If the environment variable <bf>$XCOMPOSEFILE</bf> is set, its value
is used as the name of the Compose file.

<item>If the user's home directory has a file named "<tt>.XCompose</tt>", it
is used as the Compose file.

<item>The old method is used, and the compose file is
"&lt;<it>xlocaledir</it>&gt;<tt>/</tt>&lt;<it>localename</it>&gt;<tt>/Compose</tt>".

</enum>

Compose files can now use an "include" instruction.  This allows local
modifications to be made to existing compose files without including all
of the content directly.  For example, the system's iso8859-1 compose file
can be included with a line like this:

<tscreen><verb>
include "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/iso8859-1/Compose"
</verb></tscreen>

There are two substitutions that can be made in the file name of the
include instruction.  <bf>%H</bf> expands to the user's home directory
(the <bf>$HOME</bf> environment variable), and <bf>%L</bf> expands to the
name of the locale specific Compose file (i.e., 
"&lt;<it>xlocaledir</it>&gt;<tt>/</tt>&lt;<it>localename</it>&gt;<tt>/Compose</tt>").

For example, you can include in your compose file the default Compose file
by using:

<tscreen><verb>
include "%L"
</verb></tscreen>

and then rewrite only the few rules that you need to change.  New compose
rules can be added, and previous ones replaced.

Finally, it is no longer necessary to specify in the right part of a rule
a locale encoded string in addition to the keysym name.  If the string is
omitted, Xlib figures it out from the keysym according to the current
locale.  I.e., if a rule looks like:

<tscreen><verb>
<dead_grave> <A> : "\300" Agrave
</verb></tscreen>

the result of the composition is always the letter with the "\300" code.
But if the rule is:

<tscreen><verb>
<dead_grave> <A> : Agrave
</verb></tscreen>

the result depends on how Agrave is mapped in the current locale.

<sect1>Luxi fonts from Bigelow and Holmes <label id="luxi">
<p>

XFree86 now includes the ``Luxi'' family of Type&nbsp;1 fonts and TrueType
fonts.  This family consists of the fonts ``Luxi&nbsp;Serif'',
``Luxi&nbsp;Sans'' and ``Luxi&nbsp;Mono'' in Roman, oblique, bold and
bold oblique variants.  The TrueType version have glyphs covering the
basic ASCII Unicode range, the Latin&nbsp;1 range, as well as the
<it/Extended Latin/ range and some additional punctuation characters.
In particular, these fonts include all the glyphs needed for ISO&nbsp;8859
parts 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 13 and 15, as well as all the glyphs in the Adobe
Standard encoding and the Windows 3.1  character set.

The glyph coverage of the Type&nbsp;1 versions is somewhat reduced,
and only covers ISO&nbsp;8859 parts 1, 2 and 15 as well as the Adobe
Standard encoding.

The Luxi fonts are original designs by Kris Holmes and Charles Bigelow
from Bigelow and Holmes Inc., who developed the Luxi typeface designs
in Ikarus digital format.  URW++ Design and Development GmbH converted
the Ikarus format fonts to TrueType and Type&nbsp;1 font programs and
implemented the grid-fitting "hints" and kerning tables in the Luxi
fonts.

The license terms for the Luxi fonts are included in the file
`<tt/COPYRIGHT.BH/', as well as in the <htmlurl
name="License document" url="LICENSE.html">.  For further information,

This document contains some information about features present
in XFree86 &relvers; and their status.

4 represents a significant redesign of the XFree86 X server.
Not all of the hardware drivers from 3.3.x have been ported to 4.x yet,
but conversely, 4.x has some hardware support not present in 3.3.x.
Our <htmlurl name="Driver Status document" url="Status.html"> summarizes
how the hardware driver support compares between &legacyvers; and &relvers;.
Please check there first before downloading &relvers;.

The 4.0.1 release introduced a new graphical configuration tool,
"<tt>xf86cfg</tt>", and a text mode interface was added to it for the
4.0.2 release.  It is work in progress, but definitely worth trying out.
The trusty old text-based tool "<tt>xf86config</tt>" can also be used
for generating X server config files.  In addition to these tools, we've
been working on a configuration tool that is built-in to the X
server.  It is included in the release, and it works well for some
hardware.  To try it out, just run (as root) "<tt>XFree86 -configure</tt>".
Each of these configuration options will give you a reasonable starting
point for a suitable configuration file.  We've put some effort into
documenting the &relvers; config file format, and you can find that
information in the XF86Config manual page. Check that, the driver manual
pages and the related documentation for further information.

<!--
Oh, another thing you might notice is that our documentation is rather
patchy.  Most of what is present should be in reasonable shape, but
there are gaps.  We thought it better to leave out docs that were very
out of date rather than providing inaccurate and misleading information.
We are looking for people to also help fill those gaps in &lt;hint hint
:-&gt;.
-->

Before you go to download and install the binary distributions for
this release, please have a quick read through the <htmlurl
name="Installation Document" url="Install.html">.  It may save you some
time and help you figure out which of the binary releases you need.

Unlike XFree86 3.3.x where there are multiple X server binaries, each
of which drive different hardware, XFree86 &relvers; has a single X
server binary called <tt>XFree86</tt>.  This binary can either have one
or more video drivers linked in statically, or, more usually, dynamically
load the video drivers and other modules that are needed.

XFree86 &relvers; has X server support for most UNIX(R) and UNIX-like
operating systems on Intel/x86 platforms, plus support for Linux on
Alpha, PowerPC, IA-64, Sparc, and Mips platforms, and for Darwin on PowerPC.
Work on support for additional architectures and operating systems is
in progress, and is planned for future releases.
d653 1
a653 2
The XFree86 X server has a built-in run-time loader, donated by <url
name="Metro Link" url="http://www.metrolink.com">.  This loader can load
d655 11
a665 15
Since the loader doesn't rely on an operating system's native dynamic
loader support, it works on platforms that don't provide this feature,
and makes it possible for the modules to be operating system independent
(although not, of course, independent of CPU architecture).  This means
that a module compiled on Linux/x86 can be loaded by an
X server running on Solaris/x86, or FreeBSD, or even OS/2.  
<p>
One of the
main benefits of this loader is that when modules are updated, they do not need
to be recompiled for every different operating system.  In the future
we plan to take advantage of this to provide more frequent driver module 
updates in between major releases.

The loader in version &relvers; has support for Intel (x86), Alpha and
PowerPC platforms.  It also has preliminary support for Sparc platforms.

The module interfaces (API and ABI) used in this release is still subject

guarantee this. 
d685 4
a688 4
        introduction of viruses and contaminated code can occur and wreak
         havoc on your system.  We hope to have a
	mechanism for signing/verifying the modules that we provide
	available in a future release.
d695 8
a702 194
The X server configuration file format has been extended to handle some
of the new functionality.  The <tt>xf86config</tt> utility can be used
to generate a basic config file, that may require some manual editing.
The X server also has preliminary support for generating a basic config
file.  This is done by running (as root) "<tt>XFree86 -configure</tt>".
Alternatively, the sample config file <tt>XF86Config.eg</tt> that is
installed in <tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11</tt> may be used as a starting point.
The <tt>xf86cfg</tt> utility can also be used to create a new configuration
file or to edit an existing one.
The <tt>XF86Setup</tt> utility is currently not usable, but work is
continuing in this area.

The main changes are covered here, but please refer to the <htmlurl
name="XF86Config(5)" url="XF86Config.5.html">
manual page for more comprehensive information:

<itemize>
  <item>The Module section is used to load server extension modules and
	font modules, but not XInput drivers.  The <tt>.so</tt> suffix
	should no longer be specified with module names.  Options may
	be supplied for modules by loading the module via a SubSection
	instead of the usual Load keyword.  The <tt>bitmap</tt> module
	is the only font module that is loaded by default.  No server
	extensions are loaded by default, but some are built-in to the
	server.  It is strongly recommended that the extension module
	containing a range of small miscellaneous extensions (<tt>extmod</tt>)
	be loaded because some commonly used things won't work correctly
	without it.  The following example shows how to load all the server
	extensions plus the Type1 and TrueType fonts support, and a
	commented example that shows how to pass options to an extension
	(this one is for loading the misc extensions (<tt>extmod</tt>)
	with the XFree86-VidModeExtension disabled):

<quote><verb>
Section "Module"

    Load "dbe"
    Load "record"
    Load "glx"
    Load "extmod"

    Load "type1"
    Load "freetype"

  # SubSection "extmod"
  #     Option "Omit XFree86-VidModeExtension"
  # EndSubSection

EndSection
</verb></quote>

  <item>Option flags have been extended and are now used more widely in the
	config file.  Options flags come in two main types.  The first type
	is exactly like the old form:

<quote><verb>
    Option "name"
</verb></quote>

	where the option just has a name specified.  The name is case
	insensitive, and white space and underscore characters are ignored.
	The second type consists of a name and a value:

<quote><verb>
    Option "name" "value"
</verb></quote>

	The value is passed transparently as a string to the code that
	uses the option.  Common value formats are integer, boolean,
	real, string and frequency.  The following boolean option values
	are recognised as meaning TRUE: <tt>"true"</tt>, <tt>"yes"</tt>,
	<tt>"on"</tt>, <tt>"1"</tt>, and no value.  The values recognised
	as FALSE are <tt>"false"</tt>, <tt>"no"</tt>, <tt>"off"</tt>,
	<tt>"0"</tt>.  In addition to this, <tt>"no"</tt> may be prepended
	to the <em>name</em> of a boolean option to indicate that it is
	false.  Frequency options can have the strings <tt>Hz</tt>,
	<tt>kHz</tt>, or <tt>MHz</tt> appended to the numerical value
	specified.

	Note: the value must always be enclosed in double quotes
	(<tt>"</tt>), even when it is numerical.

  <item>The ServerFlags section now accepts its parameters as Options
	instead of as special keywords.  The older keyword format is
	still recognised for compatibility purposes, but is deprecated
	and support for it will likely be dropped in a future release.
	The DPMS and screen save timeout values are now specified in the
	ServerFlags section rather than elsewhere (because they are global
	parameters, not screen-specific).  This example shows the defaults
	for these:

<quote><verb>
    Option "blank time"    "10"
    Option "standby time"  "20"
    Option "suspend time"  "30"
    Option "off time"      "40"
</verb></quote>

	The new option <tt>AllowDeactivateGrabs</tt> allows deactivating
	any active grab with the key sequence <tt>Ctrl+Alt+Keypad-Divide</tt>
	and the new option <tt>AllowClosedownGrabs</tt> allows closing the
	conection to the grabbing client with the key sequence
	<tt>Ctrl+Alt+Keypad-Multiply</tt>. Note that these options are off
	by default as they allow users to remove the grab used by screen
	saver/locker programs.

  <item>The Keyboard, Pointer and XInput sections have been replaced by a
	more general InputDevice section.  The old Keyboard and Pointer
	sections are still recognised for compatibility purposes, but
	they are discommended and support for them may be dropped in future
	releases.  The old XInput sections are no longer recognised.
	The keywords from the old sections are expressed as Options in
	the InputDevice sections.  The following example shows typical
	InputDevice sections for the core mouse and keyboard.

<quote><verb>
Section "InputDevice"
    Identifier  "Keyboard 1"
    Driver      "keyboard"
    Option      "AutoRepeat" "500 5"
    Option      "XkbModel"   "pc104"
    Option      "XkbLayout"  "us"
EndSection

Section "InputDevice"
    Identifier  "Mouse 1"
    Driver      "mouse"
    Option      "Protocol"   "PS/2"
    Option      "Device"     "/dev/mouse"
    Option	"SampleRate" "80"
EndSection
</verb></quote>

  <item>The Monitor section is mostly unchanged.  The main difference is
	that a set of VESA modes is defined internally in the server,
	and so for most monitors, it isn't necessary to specify any modes
	explicitly in the Monitor section.  There is also a new Modes section
	that can be used to define a set of modes separately from the
	Monitor section, and the Monitor section may "include" them
	with the "<tt>UseModes</tt>" keyword.  The Monitor section may also
	include Options.  Options that are monitor-specific, like the
	<tt>"DPMS"</tt> and <tt>"Sync on Green"</tt> options are best
	specified in the Monitor sections.

  <item>The Device sections are mostly unchanged.  The main difference
	is the new (and mandatory) Driver keyword that specifies which
	video driver should be loaded to drive the video card.  Another
	difference is the BusID keyword that is used to specify which of
	possibly multiple video cards the Device section is for.  The
	following is an example for a Matrox card:

<quote><verb>
Section "Device"
    Identifier "MGA 1"
    Driver     "mga"
    BusID      "PCI:1:0:0"
EndSection
</verb></quote>

  <item>The Screen sections are mostly unchanged.  The old Driver keyword
	is no longer used, and a mandatory Identifier keyword has been
	added.  The DefaultColorDepth keyword has been renamed to
	DefaultDepth.

  <item>A new section called ServerLayout has been added to allow the
	layout of the screens and the selection of input devices to be
	specified.  The ServerLayout sections may also include options
	that are normally found in the ServerFlags section.  Multiple
	ServerLayout sections may be present, and selected from the command
	line.  The following example shows a ServerLayout section for a
	dual-headed configuration with two Matrox cards, and two mice:

<quote><verb>
Section "ServerLayout"
    Identifier  "Layout 1"
    Screen      "MGA 1"
    Screen      "MGA 2" RightOf "MGA 1"
    InputDevice "Keyboard 1" "CoreKeyboard"
    InputDevice "Mouse 1"    "CorePointer"
    InputDevice "Mouse 2"    "SendCoreEvents"
    Option      "BlankTime"  "5"
EndSection
</verb></quote>

See the XF86Config man page for a more detailed explanation of the format
of the new ServerLayout section.


</itemize>

The config file search patch has been extended, with the directories
<tt>/etc/X11</tt> and <tt>/usr/X11R6/etc/X11</tt> being added.  The full
search path details are documented in the XF86Config manual page.

d707 5
a711 144
The following new X server command line options have been added:

<quote><p>

<tt>-depth</tt> <it>n</it>
<quote><p>
	This specifies the colour depth that the server is running at.
	The default is 8 for most drivers.  Most drivers support the
	values 8, 15, 16 and 24.  Some drivers also support the values
	1 and 4.  Some drivers may also support other depths.  Note that
	the depth is different from the ``bpp'' that was specified with
	previous versions.  The depth is the number of bits in each
	pixel that are significant in determining the pixel's value.
	The bpp is the total size occupied by each pixel, including bits
	that are not used.  The old <tt>-bpp</tt> option is no longer
	recognised because it isn't a good way of specifying the server
	behaviour.

</quote>

<tt>-fbbpp</tt> <it>n</it>
<quote><p>
	This specifies the bpp format to use for the framebuffer.  This
	may be used in 24-bit mode to force a framebuffer format that is
	different from what the driver chooses by default.  In most cases
	there should be no need to use this option.

</quote>

<tt>-pixmap24</tt>
<quote><p>
	This specifies that the client-side pixmap format should be the
	packed 24-bit format that was often used by the 3.3.x servers.
	The default is the more common 32-bit format.  There should normally
	be no need to use this option.

</quote>

<tt>-pixmap32</tt>
<quote><p>
	This specifies that the client-side pixmap format should be the
	sparse 32-bit format.  This is the default, so there should
	normally be no need to use this option.

</quote>

<tt>-layout</tt> <it>name</it>
<quote><p>
	This specifies which ServerLayout section in the config file to
	use.  When this option is not specified, the first ServerLayout
	section is used.  When there is no ServerLayout section, the
	first Screen section is used.

</quote>

<tt>-screen</tt> <it>name</it>
<quote><p>
	This specifies which Screen section in the config file to
	use.  When this option is not specified, the first ServerLayout
	section is used.  When there is no ServerLayout section, the
	first Screen section is used.

</quote>

<tt>-keyboard</tt> <it>name</it>
<quote><p>
	This specifies which InputDevice section in the config file to
	use for the core keyboard.  This option may be used in conjunction
	with the <tt>-screen</tt> option.

</quote>

<tt>-pointer</tt> <it>name</it>
<quote><p>
	This specifies which InputDevice section in the config file to
	use for the core pointer.  This option may be used in conjunction
	with the <tt>-screen</tt> option.

</quote>

<tt>-modulepath</tt> <it>path</it>
<quote><p>
	This specifies the module search path.  The path should be a
	comma-separated list of absolute directory paths to search for
	server modules.  When specified here, it overrides the value
	specified in the config file.  This option is only available
	when the server is started by the <tt>root</tt> user.

</quote>

<tt>-logfile</tt> <it>file</it>

XFree86 &relvers; includes sources for FreeType version 2.0.6, and, by
a874 18
<p>

If you prefer, you can configure XFree86 &relvers; to use an existing
Freetype2 installation by telling XFree86 not to build the internal copy and
indicating where that external version has been installed. Edit (or create)
<tt>config/cf/host.def</tt> to include:

<itemize>
	<item><tt>#define BuildFreetype2Library NO</tt>
	<item><tt>#define Freetype2Dir /usr/local</tt>
</itemize>

Note that XFree86 assumes you'll be using a release FreeType no older than
version 2.0.1.  Early FreeType version 2 releases used a different header file 
installation and aren't compatible with XFree86. Instructions for building and
installing FreeType can be found in the <tt>INSTALL</tt> file included with
the FreeType release.

The XFree86-VidModeExtension extension has been updated, and mostly
ported to the new server architecture.  The area of mode validation
needs further work, and the extension should be used with care.  This
extension has support for changing the gamma setting at run-time, for
modes where this is possible.  The <tt>xgamma</tt> utility makes
use of this feature.  Compatibility with the 3.3.x version of the
extension is provided.  The missing parts of this extension and some
new features should be completed in a future release.

<sect1>Xaw
<p>

Two versions of the Xaw library are provided with XFree86 4.x. A version with
bug fixes and a few binary compatible improvements and a new version with
several new features.

New features:

<itemize>

  <item>A <tt>displayList</tt> resource is available to all Xaw widgets. It
	basically consists of a list of drawing commands, fully described in
	the <tt>Xaw(3)</tt> manual page, that enables a integration of Xaw
	programs with the new window/desktop managers that allows for
	configurable themes.

  <item>Some new actions were added to all Xaw widgets, to allow more
	configurable control of the widgets, and to allow setting resources
	at run time.

  <item>Since Xpm was integrated into XFree86, programs linked with the
	new Xaw library	will also link with Xpm. This allows for color
	background pixmaps, and also for shaped widgets.

  <item>The text widget is the widget that will present more changes. These
	include:

	<itemize>

	  <item>Block cursor.

	  <item>Compile time limit of 16384 undo/redo levels (that will
		automatically grow if the text is not saved when this mark is
		reached).

	  <item>Overwrite mode.

	  <item>Text killed is inserted in a kill ring list, this text is not
		forgotten, pressing <tt>M-y</tt> allows traversing the kill
		ring list.

	  <item>International support for latin languages is available even
		if the <tt>international</tt> resource is not set. Users will
		need to properly set the <it>locale</it> environment to make
		complete use of this feature.

	  <item>A better <tt>multiply</tt> interface is provided. Pressing
		<tt>C-u,&lt;number&gt;</tt> (where number can be negative)
		allows passing parameters for text actions.

	  <item>Text can be formatted to have left, right, center or full
		justification.

	  <item>Text indentation support is also available.

	</itemize>

</itemize>

Bug fixes:

<itemize>

  <item>The simple menu widget geometry management code was improved to solve
	problems with menu entries not visible in the screen.

  <item>The form widget geometry code was changed to solve problems with integer
	round problems in the child widgets geometry when resizing the parent
	form widget.

  <item>Several bugs were fixed in the text code, while some code was rewritten
	from scratch.

</itemize>

Xedit have been changed to use most of the new features added to the new
version of the Xaw library, and some xedit only features were added. Emacs
users will find that several of the emacs key bindings work with the new
version of xedit. These include:

d928 5
a932 40

  <item>File name tab completion. Including a <it>Emacs dired</it> like window,
	that will be shown when there are more than one match, when
	<tt>C-x,d</tt> is pressed, or when a directory name is specified.

  <item>An unlimited number of files can be edited at the same time. Including
	multiple views of the same or different files.

  <item>The line number of the cursor position is always visible. It can also
	be customized to show the column number, the position offset and the
	current size of the file.

  <item>There is an <tt>autoReplace</tt> resource, that enables automatic text
	replacement at the time text is typed. This feature is useful to create
	simple macros, or to correct common spelling errors.

  <item>A fully featured ispell interface is also available. This interface
	is expected to provide most of the features of the terminal interface
	of the ispell program, with some extra features that include:

	<itemize>

	  <item>A compile time limit of 16 undo levels.

	  <item>Terse mode switch.

	  <item>Dictionary change.

	  <item>The interface also checks for repeated words.

	</itemize>

  <item>A first tentative to add programming modes was done. Currently, there
	is one mode:
	<itemize>

	  <item><bf>C-mode:</bf> this mode is expected to be stable, and fully
		usable.

One important
change is a modified search path for the X
server's <tt>XF86Config</tt> file.  The details of this can be found
in the XF86Config manual page.  The other main change is moving
most of the run-time configuration files to <tt>/etc/X11</tt>, with
symbolic links in the old <tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11</tt> location pointing
to the new location.  Some run-time generated files are now located
under the appropriate subdirectories of <tt>/var</tt>, again with the
relevant symbolic links in the old location.

4 represents a significant redesign of the XFree86 X server.  Not all
of the hardware drivers from 3.3.x have been ported to 4.x yet, but
conversely, 4.x has support for a lot of hardware that is not supported
in 3.3.x.  Our <htmlurl name="Driver Status document" url="Status.html">
summarizes how the hardware driver support compares between &legacyvers;
and &relvers;.  Please check there first before downloading &relvers;.

XFree86 4.4 introduces an automatic configuration mechanism for the
XFree86 server.  This makes it possible to start XFree86 in a usable
way without first creating a configuration file.  The initial automatic
configuration support is currently targetted towards Linux and FreeBSD.
Automatic configuration will be supported on other platforms in future
releases.  If you're running Linux or FreeBSD, try it out if you don't
already have a working <tt>XF86Config</tt> file.  If you want to customise
things afterwards, you can cut and paste the automatically generated
configuration from the <tt>/var/log/XFree86.0.log</tt> file into an
<tt>XF86Config</tt> file and make your customisations there.  Runtime
and dynamic configuration is planned for future releases.

If you don't have any luck with automatic configuration, or you are using
a platform that it isn't currently supported on, try one of the older
methods for getting started.

XFree86 comes with a graphical configuration tool called "<tt>xf86cfg</tt>".
It also has a text mode interface.  It can be used to create an iniital
configuration file, and to customise existing configurations.

Next in the order of configuration preferences is to make use of the
XFree86 server's ability to create a starting configuration file.  To
do this, just run (as root):

<tscreen><verb>
XFree86 -configure
</verb></tscreen>

and follow the instructions.

Finally, the trusty old text-based tool "<tt>xf86config</tt>" can also
be used for generating X server config files.

At least one of these configuration options will give you a reasonable
starting point for a suitable configuration file.  With the automatic
mechanism you might even find that you don't need one!  If you do need
to customise the configuration file, you can find it fully documented
in the <htmlurl name="XF86Config manual page" url="XF86Config.5.html">.
Also check the driver-specific manual pages and the related documentation
for further information.  References to this driver-specific information
can be found in the <ref id="drivertables" name="tables below">.

<item>Several stability issues with the support for the Intel 830M,
	845G, 852GM, 855GM and 865G integrated graphics chipsets have been
	fixed.  Some limitations related to the driver's use of the video
	BIOS remain, especially for some laptops.

<item>The nv driver for NVIDIA cards has been updated as follows:

	<itemize>
	<item>Support added to the nv driver for the GeForce FX 5700,
		which didn't work with XFree86 4.3.

	<item>The driver now does a much better job of autodetecting
		which connector of dual output cards the monitor is
		attached to, which should reduce or eliminate the need
		for manual XF86Config overrides.

	<item>The 2D acceleration for TNT and GeForce was completely
		rewritten.  Performance should be substantiallly improved.

	<item>TNT and GeForce cards have a new Xv PutImage adaptor which
		does scaled YUV bit blits.

	</itemize>

<item>The SiS driver has seen major updates, including:

	<itemize>
	<item>Support for 661/741/760 and support for 330 (Xabre).

	<item>Merged Framebuffer mode.

	<item>Support for DVI, and much more.

	<item>DRI for 300 series (300/305, 540, 630, 730) is supported
		again.

	</itemize>

<item>A new driver for several VIA integrated graphics chipsets has been added.

<item>Various updates and bug fixes have been made to most other drivers.

<item>tcp is an alias for both IPv6 and IPv4 transports.
<item>inet specifies IPv4 only. 
<item>inet6 specifies IPv6 only.
a183 16
<p>
You can force the X server to only listen to IPv4 connections with 
the <tt>X -nolisten inet6 </tt> command.
Or you can force a IPv6 connection by setting <bf>DISPLAY</bf> to 
<tt>inet6/host:0</tt>.

<sect2>XDM
<p>
The IPv6 XDMCP code is not enabled by default on platforms that don't 
support binding a IPv6 socket to a IPv4 address. 
<p>
The XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 authentification scheme does not support IPv6
addresses. A new release of the protocol, XDM-AUTHORIZATION-2 has been
designed, but is not implemented yet. 
Note that  by default XFree86 builds do not enable the XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1
code.

<p>
<sect2>Xterm
<p>

The user-visible changes to xterm since XFree86 4.3 are:

	Bug Fixes:
	<itemize>
	<item>Make signalInhibit resource work, i.e., disable the menu
		entries that would send signals to, or exit xterm.

	<item>Make cursor definition in tek4014 emulation work as originally
		implemented.

	<item>Modify translations for scrollbar so that one can use
		shifted pageup, wheel mouse, etc., while the mouse
		pointer is over the scrollbar.

	<item>Correct initialization of G1 character set mapping.

	</itemize>

	New Features:
	<itemize>
	<item>Modify the predictable version of the generated logfile
		name to append the process-id rather than a random value.

	<item>Modify scroll-back and scroll-forw actions to accept an
		adjustment value, e.g.,

		<tscreen><verb>
scroll-back(1, page-2)
		</verb></tscreen>

		to scroll back by 2 lines less than a page.
		
	<item>Add visualBellDelay resource to modify the length of
		time used for visual bell, for very slow displays or
		very fast computers.

	</itemize>

	Improved Locale Support:
	<itemize>
	<item>modify uxterm script to strip modifiers such as "@@euro" from the
		locale setting before adding ".UTF-8".

	<item>Add logic to wide-character support which attempts to
		load fonts specified by utf8Fonts subresources at startup.
		The subresources have the same names as the fonts which
		they replace, e.g., font, font1, etc., so that the
		ISO-10646-1 fonts can be specified in the XTerm
		app-defaults file.

	<item>Improved performance with chinput application.

	</itemize>

	Improved Font Handling:
	<itemize>
	<item>Document in xterm's manpage how to use XFree86 ":unscaled"
		keyword to suppress scaling of bold fonts.

	<item>Improved logic for deriving bold fontname from normal
		fontname.

	<item>Make double-width characters work with -u8 option.

	<item>Updated table of Unicode line-drawing characters.

	<item>Several fixes for rendering using Xft (option -fa):
		<itemize>
		<item>Make height of TrueType fonts match ascent+descent.

		<item>Translate Unicode values (from UTF-8 output to
			xterm) for line-drawing to xterm's internal
			code, etc., since TrueType fonts generally do
			not have either set of line-drawing glyphs.
			xterm can draw these directly.

		<item>Pass 16-bit values rather than 8-bit values to
			xtermXftDrawString() to allow for wide-characters.

		<item>Use built-in line-drawing characters for Xft fonts.

		<item>Implement underlining.
		</itemize>

	<item>Implement boldMode for wide-characters.

	<item>Modified to work with CJK double-width (bi-width/monospace)
		fonts.

	</itemize>

	Workarounds for Special Applications:
	<itemize>
	<item>Add option -k8 and resource allowC1Printable to allow
		users of non-VTxxx character sets such as KOI-8 to treat
		the C1 control area (character codes 128-159) as printable
		rather than control characters.

	<item>Add configure option --enable-broken-st and resource
		brokenStringTerm to allow user to revert one part of
		the parsing table corrections.

	<item>Add configure option --enable-broken-osc and resource
		brokenLinuxOSC to accommodate scripts which do not
		distinguish between running in the Linux console and
		running in X.  Linux console recognizes malformed control
		strings which start with an OSC, but are fixed-length,
		with no terminator.

	<item>Add configure option --enable-pty-handshake to allow
		one to compile-in support for the pty handshaking logic,
		and resource ptyHandshake to enable or disable it.  This
		feature is normally enabled.

	</itemize>

	Modified Resources:
	<itemize>
	<item>Change color4 to "dodger blue", since this provides
		better contrast.

	<item>Remove color resources from XTerm.ad, leaving them only
		in XTerm-col.ad

	<item>Modify UXTerm.ad resource file to include "XTerm-color"
		rather than "XTerm", in case the latter file contains
		no color resource definitions.

	<item>Changed class of veryBoldColors to VeryBoldColors, since
		ColorMode is associated with boolean resources.

	<item>Changed classes of colorBDMode and similar resources
		that override colors when a video attribute is set to
		ColorAttrMode, to make them distinct from ColorMode.
		This avoids an unexpected rendering of reverse video,
		for example.

	</itemize>

	Modified terminfo/termcap entries:
	<itemize>
	<item>Add indp and rin to terminfo entry.

	<item>Add le to termcap xterm-basic entry.  Though missing
		from older termcaps for xterm, some applications check
		for it.

	<item>Correct AF/AB strings in termcap for xterm-256color and
		xterm-88color entries.

	</itemize>

<item>FreeType2 updated to version 2.1.4.

<item>The "freetype" X server font backend has been updated by the
	<url name="After X-TT Project" url="http://x-tt.sourceforge.jp/"> to
	include the functionality previously provided by the "xtt" backend,
	and to fix some bugs.  The "xtt" backend will be dropped in the
	next release in favour of the updated unified "freetype" backend.

	<itemize>
	<item>The new "freetype" backend has the improved "very lazy" metric
		calculation method which enables super-fast loading of
		proportional CJKV fonts.

	<item>All of the servers, including xfs, Xnest, Xprt, Xvfb, the
		Cygwin-XFree86 server (as well as the XFree86 server)
		can handle the perfect TTCap options.

	</itemize>

	more flexible.  See the <ref id="compose" name="Xlib Compose
	file support and extensions section below">.  </itemize>

<item>On Mac OS X, the appropriate backend drawing code is now dynamically
	loaded at runtime. This reduces the X server's memory footprint.
	In rootless mode, Apple's Xplugin library is used where available.
	(Xplugin is included as part of Mac OS X on Panther.) With Xplugin,
	XDarwin provides identical performance to Apple's X11, including
	the following improvements over 4.3:

d243 8
a250 12

<item>On Darwin, IOKit mode now uses shadowfb for much faster drawing.

<item>Various GNU/Hurd support updates.

<item>Experimental support added for GNU/KFreeBSD and GNU/KNetBSD systems.

<item>SCO OpenServer support updates.  XFree86 4.4 now works on Release
5.0.7 with Maintenance Pack 1, or on prior releases through Release
5.0.4.  Please consult the <htmlurl name="README.SCO" url="SCO.html">

Drivers marked with (*) are available for Linux only.

XFree86 4.x has a single X server binary called <tt>XFree86</tt>.  This
binary can either have one or more video and input drivers linked in
statically, or, more usually, dynamically load the video drivers, input
drivers, and other modules that are needed.

XFree86 &relvers; has X server support for most UNIX&reg; and UNIX-like
operating systems on Intel/x86 platforms, plus support for Linux and
some BSD OSs on Alpha, PowerPC, IA-64, AMD64, Sparc, and Mips platforms,
and for Darwin on PowerPC.  Work on support for additional architectures
and operating systems is in progress, and is planned for future releases.

a428 13
The XFree86 X server has a built-in run-time loader developed from code
donated by <url name="Metro Link" url="http://www.metrolink.com">.  This
loader can load normal object files and libraries in most of the commonly
used formats.  Since the loader doesn't rely on an operating system's
native dynamic loader support, it works on platforms that don't provide
this feature, and makes it possible for the modules to be operating
system independent (although not, of course, independent of CPU
architecture).  This means that a module compiled on Linux/x86 can be
loaded by an X server running on Solaris/x86, or FreeBSD, or even OS/2.

One of the main benefits of this loader is that when modules are
updated, they do not need to be recompiled for every different operating
system.

The XFree86 server uses a configuration file as the primary mechanism
for providing configuration and run-time parameters.  The configuration
file format is described in detail in the <htmlurl name="XF86Config(5)"
url="XF86Config.5.html"> manual page.

The XFree86 server has support for automatically determining an initial
configuration on most platforms, as well as support or generating a basic
initial configuration file.
d657 144

Command line options can be used to override some default parameters and
parameters provided in the configuration file.  These command line options
are described in the <htmlurl name="XFree86(1)"

"FreeType" backend (the <tt>"freetype"</tt> module) and `X-TrueType'
(the <tt>"xtt"</tt> module).  Both of these backends are based on the
FreeType library.  The functionality of X-TrueType has been merged into
the FreeType backend by the After X-TT Project for XFree86 4.4.
Consequently, the old X-TrueType backend will be dropped as of XFree86
4.5.
a1276 61
<sect1>Xlib Compose file support and extensions <label id="compose">
<p>

A more flexible Compose file processing system was added to Xlib in
XFree86 4.4.0.  The compose file is searched for in the following order:

<enum>
<item>If the environment variable <bf>$XCOMPOSEFILE</bf> is set, its value
is used as the name of the Compose file.

<item>If the user's home direcotry has a file named "<tt>.XCompose</tt>", it
is used as the Compose file.

<item>The old method is used, and the compose file is
"&lt;<it>xlocaledir</it>&gt;<tt>/</tt>&lt;<it>localename</it>&gt;<tt>/Compose</tt>".

</enum>

Compose files can now use an "include" instruction.  This allows local
modifications to be made to existing compose files without including all
of the content directly.  For example, the system's iso8859-1 compose file
can be included with a line like this:

<tscreen><verb>
include "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/iso8859-1/Compose"
</verb></tscreen>

There are two substitutions that can be made in the file name of the
include instruction.  <bf>%H</bf> expands to the user's home directory
(the <bf>$HOME</bf> environment variable), and <bf>%L</bf> expands to the
name of the locale specific Compose file (i.e., 
"&lt;<it>xlocaledir</it>&gt;<tt>/</tt>&lt;<it>localename</it>&gt;<tt>/Compose</tt>").

For example, you can include in your compose file the default Compose file
by using:

<tscreen><verb>
include "%L"
</verb></tscreen>

and then rewrite only the few rules that you need to change.  New compose
rules can be added, and previous ones replaced.

Finally, it is no longer necessary to specify in the right part of a rule
a locale encoded string in addition to the keysym name.  If the string is
opmitted, Xlib figures it out from the keysym according to the current
locale.  I.e., if a rule looks like:

<tscreen><verb>
<dead_grave> <A> : "\300" Agrave
</verb></tscreen>

the result of the composition is always the letter with the "\300" code.
But if the rule is:

<tscreen><verb>
<dead_grave> <A> : Agrave
</verb></tscreen>

the result depends on how Agrave is mapped in the current locale.

XFree86 server which makes it now possible to start XFree86 without first
creating a configuration file.  The initial automatic configuration
support is targeted towards Linux and FreeBSD and it is hoped that
automatic configuration will be supported on other platforms in
future releases. 

If you are running either  Linux or FreeBSD, try it out if you
do not already have a working <tt>XF86Config</tt> file.  If you want to
customise things afterwards, you can cut and paste the automatically
generated configuration from the <tt>/var/log/XFree86.0.log</tt> file
into an <tt>XF86Config</tt> file and make your customisations there.

If you do not have any luck with automatic configuration, or you are using
a platform that is not currently supported, try one of the older methods
for getting started.

XFree86 comes with a graphical configuration tool called "<tt>xf86cfg</tt>",
which also has a text mode interface and can be used to create an initial
configuration file. It can also be used to customise existing
configurations.

Next in the order of configuration preferences is to use the XFree86
server's ability to create a starting configuration file.  Run as root:
d74 16
a89 18
Finally, if all else fails, the trusty old standby text-based tool
"<tt>xf86config</tt>" can also be used for generating X server config
files.

At least one, and hopefully, all of these configuration options will
give you a reasonable starting point for a suitable configuration
file.  With the automatic mechanism you might even find that you don't
need one!  

If you do need to customise the configuration file, see the <htmlurl
name="XF86Config manual page" url="XF86Config.5.html">.  You can also
check the driver-specific manual pages and the related documentation
(found at <ref id="drivertables" name="tables below"> also.

Before downloading  the binary distributions for this release, please
have a quick read through the <htmlurl name="Installation Document"
url="Install.html">.  It may save you some time and also help you figure out
which of the binary releases you need.

<item>Known issues with this version of the SiS driver:

	<itemize>
	<item>The driver will not work with upcoming laptops/notebooks
	with 661/741/760 and 30xLV bridges as regards LCD output. This
	is due folks at SiS at the very moment writing an entirely new
	VBIOS for such machines whose data layout is not decided yet.
	(This might affect machines with 650/740 as well within the next
	year.)

	<item>Xv does not work correctly in TV NTSC 1024x768 mode, if
	the overlay is very large (or full screen). The effect are
	flickering lines on the screen. This is a hardware problem. Do
	not use this mode for video.

	<item>YPbPr 720p output is blurry (at least at 1024x768; unknown
	for other modes). This is a driver problem; solution currently
	unknown.

	</itemize>

<item>We have received a late report that enabling DPMS support with
the radeon driver can damage some Viewsonic monitors.  DPMS is usually
disabled by default.  You can verify whether or not DPMS is enabled by
running 'xset q' from within your X session.

work, and the extension should be used with care.  This extension has
support for changing the gamma setting at run-time, for modes where this
is possible.  The <tt>xgamma</tt> utility makes use of this feature.
Compatibility with the 3.3.x version of the extension is provided.
The missing parts of this extension and some new features should be

4 represents a significant redesign of the XFree86 X server.  Not all
of the hardware drivers from 3.3.x have been ported to 4.x yet, but
conversely, 4.x has support for a lot of hardware that is not supported
in 3.3.x.  Our <htmlurl name="Driver Status document" url="Status.html">
summarizes how the hardware driver support compares between &legacyvers;
and &relvers;.  Please check there first before downloading &relvers;.

4.0.2 release.  It is the preferred configuration tool provided by with
XFree86.  The trusty old text-based tool "<tt>xf86config</tt>" can also
be used for generating X server config files.  In addition to these
tools, the XFree86 server has some built in capabilities for generating
a base config file.  This works well for most hardware, and in most
cases is the easiest way to get an initial config file.  To try it out,
just run (as root):

<tscreen><verb>
XFree86 -configure
</verb></tscreen>

pages and the related documentation for further information.  References
to this driver-specific information can be found in the <ref id="drivertables"
name="tables below">.

We have plans to make the configuration file optional in a future release.
The XFree86 server is close to being able to automatically determine
a complete base configuration for most popular hardware configurations.

	into the XFree86 server, providing support for resizing the root
	window at run-time.

<item> The Mesa version used for OpenGL&reg; 1.3 and DRI 
	driver support has been updated to 4.0.4.

<item> The XFree86 server's hot keys (including those for switching
	modes and virtual terminals) can now be configured via XKB.
	Previously they were hard coded.  An X server configuration
	option has been added to allow the VT switching hot keys to be
	disabled.

d189 6
a194 30
<item> An Xcursor library providing support for alpha blended (ARGB)
	and animated cursors.  Two Xcursor themes are provided (redglass
	and whiteglass), as well as the default "core" theme (the traditional
	cursors).

<item> Xterm updated to patch level 173, including the following bugfixes:
	<itemize>
	<item> Fix two infinite loops (special cases of mouse hilite tracking,
		DECUDK parsing).
	<item> Make repainting of the 256-color example work properly.
	<item> Modify parser tables to improve detection of malformed
		control sequences, making xterm behave more like a real
		DEC terminal.
	<item> Fix a problem with the blinking cursor which occasionally caused
		xterm to pause until a key was pressed.
	<item> Fix improper parsing of multiple items in the ttyModes resource.

	</itemize>
	and the following improvements:
	<itemize>
	<item> Modify xterm to invoke luit.
	<item> Add simple session management client capabilities.
	<item> Add a modifyCursorKeys resource to control how the shift- and
		similar modifiers are used to make a cursor escape sequence.
	<item> Check if the printerCommand resource string is empty,
		and use this to allow the user to disable printer function.
	<item> Sort the options list which is displayed in help- and
		syntax-messages at runtime to simplify maintenance.
	</itemize>

d201 16
a216 27
<item> FreeType2 updated to version 2.1.1.

<item> The "freetype" X server font backend has undergone a partial rewrite.
	The new version is based on FreeType 2, and handles TrueType
	(including OpenType/TTF), OpenType/CFF and Type 1 fonts.  The old
	"type1" backend is now deprecated, and is only used for CIDFonts
	by default.

<item> A new utility called "mkfontscale", which builds fonts.scale files,
	has been added.

<item> The Xft library has undergone a major restructuring, and is now
	split into fontconfig (which deals with font discovery and
	configuration and is independent from X), and Xft itself (which
	uses fontconfig and deals with font rasterisation and rendering.
	The format of the Xft font configuration files has changed in
	an incompatible manner.

<item> Support has been added to the Xft library to do rendering with the
	core X11 protocol.  This allows clients using this library to
	render to X servers that don't have support for the RENDER extension.

<item> There has been a significant reworking of the XKB support to allow
	multi-layout configurations.  Multi-layout configurations provide
	a flexible way of supporting multiple language layouts and switching
	between them.

XFree86 4.4 introduces an automatic configuration mechanism for the
XFree86 server.  This makes it possible to start XFree86 in a usable
way without first creating a configuration file.  The initial automatic
configuration support is currently targetted towards Linux and FreeBSD.
Automatic configuration will be supported on other platforms in future
releases.  If you're running Linux or FreeBSD, try it out if you don't
already have a working <tt>XF86Config</tt> file.  If you want to customise
things afterwards, you can cut and paste the automatically generated
configuration from the <tt>/var/log/XFree86.0.log</tt> file into an
<tt>XF86Config</tt> file and make your customisations there.  Runtime
and dynamic configuration is planned for future releases.

If you don't have any luck with automatic configuration, or you are using
a platform that it isn't currently supported on, try one of the older
methods for getting started.

XFree86 comes with a graphical configuration tool called "<tt>xf86cfg</tt>".
It also has a text mode interface.  It can be used to create an iniital
configuration file, and to customise existing configurations.

Next in the order of configuration preferences is to make use of the
XFree86 server's ability to create a starting configuration file.  To
do this, just run (as root):
d58 12
a69 13
and follow the instructions.

Finally, the trusty old text-based tool "<tt>xf86config</tt>" can also
be used for generating X server config files.

At least one of these configuration options will give you a reasonable
starting point for a suitable configuration file.  With the automatic
mechanism you might even find that you don't need one!  If you do need
to customise the configuration file, you can find it fully documented
in the <htmlurl name="XF86Config manual page" url="XF86Config.5.html">.
Also check the driver-specific manual pages and the related documentation
for further information.  References to this driver-specific information
can be found in the <ref id="drivertables" name="tables below">.

<item>Several stability issues with the support for the Intel 830M,
	845G, 852GM, 855GM and 865G integrated graphics chipsets have been
	fixed.  Some limitations related to the driver's use of the video
	BIOS remain, especially for some laptops.

<item>The nv driver for NVIDIA cards has been updated as follows:

	<itemize>
	<item>Support added to the nv driver for the GeForce FX 5700,
		which didn't work with XFree86 4.3.

	<item>The driver now does a much better job of autodetecting
		which connector of dual output cards the monitor is
		attached to, which should reduce or eliminate the need
		for manual XF86Config overrides.

<sect1>IPv6 support
<p>
XFree86 4.4 supports IPv6, based on the code contributed by Sun
Microsystems to X.Org. See 
<url name="X.org's document" url="http://www.x.org/IPV6_Specific_Changes.html"> for a detailled list of the changes. 

<sect2>Protocol names and aliases. 
<p>
<itemize>
<item>tcp is an alias for both IPv6 and IPv4 transports.
<item>inet specifies IPv4 only. 
<item>inet6 specifies IPv6 only.
</itemize>
<p>
You can force the X server to only listen to IPv4 connections with 
the <tt>X -nolisten inet6 </tt> command.
Or you can force a IPv6 connection by setting <bf>DISPLAY</bf> to 
<tt>inet6/host:0</tt>.

<sect2>XDM
<p>
The IPv6 XDMCP code is not enabled by default on platforms that don't 
support binding a IPv6 socket to a IPv4 address. 
<p>
The XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 authentification scheme does not support IPv6
addresses. A new release of the protocol, XDM-AUTHORIZATION-2 has been
designed, but is not implemented yet. 
Note that  by default XFree86 builds do not enable the XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1
code.

The user-visible changes to xterm since XFree86 4.3 are:

	Bug Fixes:
d177 9
a185 11
	<item>Make signalInhibit resource work, i.e., disable the menu
		entries that would send signals to, or exit xterm.

	<item>Make cursor definition in tek4014 emulation work as originally
		implemented.

	<item>Modify translations for scrollbar so that one can use
		shifted pageup, wheel mouse, etc., while the mouse
		pointer is over the scrollbar.

	<item>Correct initialization of G1 character set mapping.
d188 1
a188 2

	New Features:
d190 8
a197 16
	<item>Modify the predictable version of the generated logfile
		name to append the process-id rather than a random value.

	<item>Modify scroll-back and scroll-forw actions to accept an
		adjustment value, e.g.,

		<tscreen><verb>
scroll-back(1, page-2)
		</verb></tscreen>

		to scroll back by 2 lines less than a page.
		
	<item>Add visualBellDelay resource to modify the length of
		time used for visual bell, for very slow displays or
		very fast computers.

d200 1
a200 113
	Improved Locale Support:
	<itemize>
	<item>modify uxterm script to strip modifiers such as "@@euro" from the
		locale setting before adding ".UTF-8".

	<item>Add logic to wide-character support which attempts to
		load fonts specified by utf8Fonts subresources at startup.
		The subresources have the same names as the fonts which
		they replace, e.g., font, font1, etc., so that the
		ISO-10646-1 fonts can be specified in the XTerm
		app-defaults file.

	<item>Improved performance with chinput application.

	</itemize>

	Improved Font Handling:
	<itemize>
	<item>Document in xterm's manpage how to use XFree86 ":unscaled"
		keyword to suppress scaling of bold fonts.

	<item>Improved logic for deriving bold fontname from normal
		fontname.

	<item>Make double-width characters work with -u8 option.

	<item>Updated table of Unicode line-drawing characters.

	<item>Several fixes for rendering using Xft (option -fa):
		<itemize>
		<item>Make height of TrueType fonts match ascent+descent.

		<item>Translate Unicode values (from UTF-8 output to
			xterm) for line-drawing to xterm's internal
			code, etc., since TrueType fonts generally do
			not have either set of line-drawing glyphs.
			xterm can draw these directly.

		<item>Pass 16-bit values rather than 8-bit values to
			xtermXftDrawString() to allow for wide-characters.

		<item>Use built-in line-drawing characters for Xft fonts.

		<item>Implement underlining.
		</itemize>

	<item>Implement boldMode for wide-characters.

	<item>Modified to work with CJK double-width (bi-width/monospace)
		fonts.

	</itemize>

	Workarounds for Special Applications:
	<itemize>
	<item>Add option -k8 and resource allowC1Printable to allow
		users of non-VTxxx character sets such as KOI-8 to treat
		the C1 control area (character codes 128-159) as printable
		rather than control characters.

	<item>Add configure option --enable-broken-st and resource
		brokenStringTerm to allow user to revert one part of
		the parsing table corrections.

	<item>Add configure option --enable-broken-osc and resource
		brokenLinuxOSC to accommodate scripts which do not
		distinguish between running in the Linux console and
		running in X.  Linux console recognizes malformed control
		strings which start with an OSC, but are fixed-length,
		with no terminator.

	<item>Add configure option --enable-pty-handshake to allow
		one to compile-in support for the pty handshaking logic,
		and resource ptyHandshake to enable or disable it.  This
		feature is normally enabled.

	</itemize>

	Modified Resources:
	<itemize>
	<item>Change color4 to "dodger blue", since this provides
		better contrast.

	<item>Remove color resources from XTerm.ad, leaving them only
		in XTerm-col.ad

	<item>Modify UXTerm.ad resource file to include "XTerm-color"
		rather than "XTerm", in case the latter file contains
		no color resource definitions.

	<item>Changed class of veryBoldColors to VeryBoldColors, since
		ColorMode is associated with boolean resources.

	<item>Changed classes of colorBDMode and similar resources
		that override colors when a video attribute is set to
		ColorAttrMode, to make them distinct from ColorMode.
		This avoids an unexpected rendering of reverse video,
		for example.

	</itemize>

	Modified terminfo/termcap entries:
	<itemize>
	<item>Add indp and rin to terminfo entry.

	<item>Add le to termcap xterm-basic entry.  Though missing
		from older termcaps for xterm, some applications check
		for it.

	<item>Correct AF/AB strings in termcap for xterm-256color and
		xterm-88color entries.

	</itemize>

<item>The "freetype" X server font backend has been updated by the
	<url name="After X-TT Project" url="http://x-tt.sourceforge.jp/"> to
	include the functionality previously provided by the "xtt" backend,
	and to fix some bugs.  The "xtt" backend will be dropped in the
	next release in favour of the updated unified "freetype" backend.

a233 14
	<itemize>
	<item>The new "freetype" backend has the improved "very lazy" metric

	<item>All of the servers, including xfs, Xnest, Xprt, Xvfb, the
		Cygwin-XFree86 server (as well as the XFree86 server)
		can handle the perfect TTCap options.

	</itemize>

<item>On Mac OS X, the appropriate backend drawing code is now dynamically
	loaded at runtime. This reduces the X server's memory footprint.
	In rootless mode, Apple's Xplugin library is used where available.
	(Xplugin is included as part of Mac OS X on Panther.) With Xplugin,
	XDarwin provides identical performance to Apple's X11, including
	the following improvements over 4.3:
d241 5
a245 4
	<item>Added direct GLX rendering with thread support.
	<item>Faster 2-D drawing.

XFree86 4.x has a single X server binary called <tt>XFree86</tt>.  This
binary can either have one or more video and input drivers linked in
statically, or, more usually, dynamically load the video drivers, input
drivers, and other modules that are needed.

XFree86 &relvers; has X server support for most UNIX&reg; and UNIX-like
operating systems on Intel/x86 platforms, plus support for Linux and
some BSD OSs on Alpha, PowerPC, IA-64, AMD64, Sparc, and Mips platforms,
and for Darwin on PowerPC.  Work on support for additional architectures
and operating systems is in progress, and is planned for future releases.
d448 15
a462 13
The XFree86 X server has a built-in run-time loader developed from code
donated by <url name="Metro Link" url="http://www.metrolink.com">.  This
loader can load normal object files and libraries in most of the commonly
used formats.  Since the loader doesn't rely on an operating system's
native dynamic loader support, it works on platforms that don't provide
this feature, and makes it possible for the modules to be operating
system independent (although not, of course, independent of CPU
architecture).  This means that a module compiled on Linux/x86 can be
loaded by an X server running on Solaris/x86, or FreeBSD, or even OS/2.

One of the main benefits of this loader is that when modules are
updated, they do not need to be recompiled for every different operating
system.

The module interfaces (API and ABI) used in this release is subject

not guaranteed because new modules may rely on interfaces added in new

The XFree86 server uses a configuration file as the primary mechanism
for providing configuration and run-time parameters.  The configuration
file format is described in detail in the <htmlurl name="XF86Config(5)"
url="XF86Config.5.html"> manual page.

The XFree86 server has support for automatically determining an initial
configuration on most platforms, as well as support or generating a basic
initial configuration file.

Command line options can be used to override some default parameters and
parameters provided in the configuration file.  These command line options
are described in the <htmlurl name="XFree86(1)"
url="XFree86.1.html"> manual page.

XFree86 &relvers; includes sources for FreeType version 2.1.4, and, by
d1094 3
a1096 6
"FreeType" backend (the <tt>"freetype"</tt> module) and `X-TrueType'
(the <tt>"xtt"</tt> module).  Both of these backends are based on the
FreeType library.  The functionality of X-TrueType has been merged into
the FreeType backend by the After X-TT Project for XFree86 4.4.
Consequently, the old X-TrueType backend will be dropped as of XFree86
4.5.

<sect1>Xlib Compose file support and extensions <label id="compose">
<p>

A more flexible Compose file processing system was added to Xlib in
XFree86 4.4.0.  The compose file is searched for in the following order:

<enum>
<item>If the environment variable <bf>$XCOMPOSEFILE</bf> is set, its value
is used as the name of the Compose file.

<item>If the user's home direcotry has a file named "<tt>.XCompose</tt>", it
is used as the Compose file.

<item>The old method is used, and the compose file is
"&lt;<it>xlocaledir</it>&gt;<tt>/</tt>&lt;<it>localename</it>&gt;<tt>/Compose</tt>".

</enum>

Compose files can now use an "include" instruction.  This allows local
modifications to be made to existing compose files without including all
of the content directly.  For example, the system's iso8859-1 compose file
can be included with a line like this:

<tscreen><verb>
include "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/iso8859-1/Compose"
</verb></tscreen>

There are two substitutions that can be made in the file name of the
include instruction.  <bf>%H</bf> expands to the user's home directory
(the <bf>$HOME</bf> environment variable), and <bf>%L</bf> expands to the
name of the locale specific Compose file (i.e., 
"&lt;<it>xlocaledir</it>&gt;<tt>/</tt>&lt;<it>localename</it>&gt;<tt>/Compose</tt>").

For example, you can include in your compose file the default Compose file
by using:

<tscreen><verb>
include "%L"
</verb></tscreen>

and then rewrite only the few rules that you need to change.  New compose
rules can be added, and previous ones replaced.

Finally, it is no longer necessary to specify in the right part of a rule
a locale encoded string in addition to the keysym name.  If the string is
opmitted, Xlib figures it out from the keysym according to the current
locale.  I.e., if a rule looks like:

<tscreen><verb>
<dead_grave> <A> : "\300" Agrave
</verb></tscreen>

the result of the composition is always the letter with the "\300" code.
But if the rule is:

<tscreen><verb>
<dead_grave> <A> : Agrave
</verb></tscreen>

the result depends on how Agrave is mapped in the current locale.

@           Information for NVidia NV1 / SGS-Thomson STG2000 Users

                                 David McKay

                               20th March 1997

1.  XFree driver for NVidia NV1 / SGS-Thomson STG2000 v1.0

This driver now accelerates bitblits and filled rectangles. It also support a
hardware cursor.  More graphic acceleration is planned. There is no plan to
support the audio functionality of the chip.

1.1  Notes

   o THE DRIVER DOES NOT SUPPORT THE VIRTUAL DESKTOP FEATURES OF XFREE86 This
     is because the NV1 does not have the necessary hardware to support this
     feature. If you want to change resolutions, you will have to modify your
     config file. Comment out all but the mode you wish to use.

   o The generic VGA16 server will not work with the NV1.  For this reason
     XF86Setup cannot be used to configure the server.  Use xf86config
     instead.  Select `Diamond Edge 3D' as your board, and select only ONE
     mode for each of 8bpp and 16bpp.  Do not select a virtual desktop.
     Also, make sure you don't select a RAMDAC or clock chip.

   o The NV1 only supports a 555 RGB Weight in 16 bpp, the hardware does not
     do 565. You must put a Weight 555 in the Display section.

   o 24/32 bpp mode is not yet supported.

1.2  Known Bugs

   o The driver should force Weight 555 in 16 bpp mode

   o The hardware cursor doesn't work if an doublescan mode is selected.

   o Screen blanking doesn't work, nor does DPMS.

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

<abstract>
This document describes how to build XFree86 from the <bf>source</bf>
distribution and is designed to
be used in conjunction with the operating system (OS) specific README files.
</abstract>

<toc>

<p>
<quote>
<bf/NOTE:/  Refer to the appropriate OS-specific README file before attempting
       to build XFree86.  These files often contain additional information that 
       you need to successfully build for your OS.
</quote>


We highly recommend using gcc to build XFree86, but XFree86 also
generally builds with the native compiler for each OS platform; 

<sect>How to get the XFree86 &relvers; source
<p>

The recommended way of getting the XFree86 &relvers; source is to
obtain it directly from the XFree86 CVS repository.  There are several
ways of doing that, and they are described at our <url name="CVS web page"
url="http://www.xfree86.org/cvs/">  The CVS tag for this release is
"<tt>&reltag;</tt>".  <![ %fullrel; [ The tag for the maintenance branch
for this release is "<tt>&relbranchtag;</tt>".]]>

<![ %notsnapshot; [
Another method of getting the XFree86 &relvers; source is to
either download the &fullrelvers; source tarballs from the XFree86 ftp
site<![ %updaterel; [ and the source patch that updates &fullrelvers; to
&relvers]]>.  The procedure for this is as follows:
<itemize>
  <item>The XFree86 &fullrelvers; source is contained in the files:

	<quote><tt>
	XFree86-&fullrelvers;-src-1.tgz<newline>
	XFree86-&fullrelvers;-src-2.tgz<newline>
	XFree86-&fullrelvers;-src-3.tgz<newline>
	XFree86-&fullrelvers;-src-4.tgz<newline>
	XFree86-&fullrelvers;-src-5.tgz<newline>
	XFree86-&fullrelvers;-src-6.tgz<newline>
	XFree86-&fullrelvers;-src-7.tgz<newline>
	</tt></quote>

	These can be found at <htmlurl
	name="ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/XFree86/&fullrelvers;/source/"
	url="ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/XFree86/&fullrelvers;/source/">
	and similar locations on XFree86 mirror sites.
	<tt>XFree86-&fullrelvers;-src-4.tgz</tt> and
	<tt>XFree86-&fullrelvers;-src-5.tgz</tt> contains the fonts.
	<tt>XFree86-&fullrelvers;-src-6.tgz</tt> contains the documentation
	source.  <tt>XFree86-&fullrelvers;-src-7.tgz</tt> contains the
	hardcopy documentation.  <tt>XFree86-&fullrelvers;-src-1.tgz</tt>,
	<tt>XFree86-&fullrelvers;-src-2.tgz</tt> and
	<tt>XFree86-&fullrelvers;-src-3.tgz</tt> contains everything
	else.  If you don't need the docs or fonts you can get by with
	only <tt>XFree86-&fullrelvers;-src-1.tgz</tt>,
	<tt>XFree86-&fullrelvers;-src-2.tgz</tt> and
	<tt>XFree86-&fullrelvers;-src-3.tgz</tt>.

  <item>Extract each of these files by running the following from a directory
	on a filesystem containing enough space (the full source requires
	around 305MB, and a similar amount is required in addition to this
	for the compiled binaries):
	<quote><tt>
	gzip -d &lt; XFree86-&fullrelvers;-src-1.tgz | tar vxf -<newline>
	gzip -d &lt; XFree86-&fullrelvers;-src-2.tgz | tar vxf -<newline>
	gzip -d &lt; XFree86-&fullrelvers;-src-3.tgz | tar vxf -<newline>
	gzip -d &lt; XFree86-&fullrelvers;-src-4.tgz | tar vxf -<newline>
	gzip -d &lt; XFree86-&fullrelvers;-src-5.tgz | tar vxf -<newline>
	gzip -d &lt; XFree86-&fullrelvers;-src-6.tgz | tar vxf -<newline>
	gzip -d &lt; XFree86-&fullrelvers;-src-7.tgz | tar vxf -<newline>
	</tt></quote>

<![ %updaterel; [
  <item>A patch relative to &fullrelvers is available at
	<htmlurl
	name="ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/XFree86/&relvers;/patches/"
	url="ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/XFree86/&relvers;/patches/">.
	The patch file is <tt>&fullrelvers;-&relvers;.diff.gz</tt>.

	The patch can be applied by running:
	<quote><tt>
	cd <em>the directory containing the</em> xc <em>directory</em><newline>
	gzip -d &lt; &fullrelvers;-&relvers;.diff.gz | patch -s -p0 -E 
	</tt>
	</quote>
	Look for special patching instructions in the "How to get XFree86"
	section of the <htmlurl name="README" url="README.html"> for
	this release.
]]>
</itemize>

<![ %fullrel; [
Alternatively, if you already have a pristine copy of the XFree86
&prevfullrelvers; source, you can download patches from
<htmlurl name="ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/XFree86/&relvers;/patches/"
url="ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/XFree86/&relvers;/patches/"> that will allow
you to convert it to &relvers;.  Information about which patch files to
download and how to apply them can be found in the "How to get XFree86"
section of the <htmlurl name="README" url="README.html"> for this release.
]]>
]]>

<![ %snapshot; [
<p>
Alternatively you can download the source for the XFree86 &relvers;
snapshot as a tarball from <htmlurl
name="ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/XFree86/develsnaps/XFree86-&relvers;.tar.bz2"
url="ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/XFree86/develsnaps/XFree86-&relvers;.tar.bz2">.
This can be extracted by running:

	<quote><tt>
	bzip2 -d &lt; XFree86-&relvers;.tar.bz2 | tar vxf -<newline>
	</tt></quote>

]]>

All methods will produce one main source directory called <tt>xc</tt>. 


<sect>Configuring the source before building
<p>
In most cases it shouldn't be necessary to configure anything before building.

If you do want to make configuration changes, it is recommended that
you start by going to the <tt>xc/config/cf</tt> directory, and copying
the file <tt>xf86site.def</tt> to <tt>host.def</tt>.  Then read through
the <tt>host.def</tt> file (which is heavily commented), and set your 
configuration parameters. Usually you can find
the default settings by checking the <tt>.cf</tt> file(s) relevant to your OS.

A good rule to follow is only to change things that you understand
as it's  easy to create build problems by changing the default configuration.  
Check the configuration parameters specified in the <tt>xc/config/cf/README</tt>.

<!--
Another spot to check is a section <ref name="below" id="config_params">
 with information about configuration settings.
-->

<![ %notsnapshot; [
If you are using just the <tt>XFree86-&fullrelvers;-src-1.tgz</tt>,
<tt>XFree86-&fullrelvers;-src-2.tgz</tt> and
<tt>XFree86-&fullrelvers;-src-3.tgz</tt> parts of the source dist, you
will need to define <bf>BuildFonts</bf> to <bf>NO</bf>.
]]>

<sect>Using a shadow directory of symbolic links for the build
<p>
A recommended practice is to use a shadow directory of symbolic links
to do the build of XFree86 as this allows you to keep the source directory
unmodified during the build.  It has the following benefits:
<itemize>
<item>When you are using CVS to maintain your source tree, 
the update process is not disturbed by foreign files not under
CVS's control. 
<item>It is possible to build XFree86 for several different Operating
System or architectures from the same sources, shared by read-only NFS
mounts.
<item>It is possible to build XFree86 with different configuration
options, by putting a real copy of the <tt>host.def</tt> file in
each build tree and by customizing it separately in each build tree.
</itemize>
<p>
To make a shadow directory of symbolic links, use the following steps:
<itemize>
<item>create the directory at the top of the build tree. It is often
created at the same level that the <tt>xc</tt> directory, but this is
not mandatory. 
<quote><tt>
cd <em>the directory containing the </em>xc<em>directory</em><newline>
mkdir build
</tt></quote>
<item>use the "<tt>lndir</tt>" command to make the shadow tree:
<quote><tt>
lndir ../xc
</tt></quote>
Note that you can refer to the <tt>xc</tt> directory with an absolute
path if needed. 
<p>
See the <htmlurl name="lndir(1)"
url="http://www.xfree86.org/&relvers;/lndir.1.html"> manual page for
details.
</itemize>
If <tt>lndir</tt> is not already installed on your system, you can
build it manually from the XFree86 sources by running the following
commands: 
<quote><tt>
cd xc/config/util<newline>
make -f Makefile.ini lndir<newline>
cp lndir <em>some directory in your PATH</em>
</tt></quote>

Occasionally there may be stale links in the build tree, like 
when files in the source tree are removed or renamed.  These can
be cleaned up by running the "<tt>cleanlinks</tt>" script from the build
directory (see the <htmlurl name="cleanlinks(1)" url="cleanlinks.1.html">
manual page).  Rarely there will be changes that will require the build
tree to be re-created from scratch.  A symptom of this can be mysterious
build problems.  The best solution for this is to remove the build tree,
and then re-create it using the steps outlined above.

<sect>Building and installing the distribution
<p>
Before building the distribution, read through the OS-specific <tt/README/
file in <tt>xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/doc</tt> that is relevant to
you.  Once you have addressed the OS-specific details, go your
build directory 
(either the <tt/xc/ directory or the shadow tree created before) and
run "<tt/make World/" with the <bf/BOOTSTRAPCFLAGS/ 
set as described in the OS-specific README (if necessary, but most
systems supported by XFree86 don't need <bf/BOOTSTRAPCFLAGS/).  It is
advisable to redirect stdout and stderr to <tt/World.Log/ so that you
can track down problems that might occur during the build.
<p> 
With Bourne-like shells (Bash, the Korn shell, <tt>zsh</tt>, etc.) use
a command like:
<quote><tt>
make World &gt; World.log 2&gt;&amp;1
</tt></quote>
Witch C-shell variants (<tt>csh</tt>, <tt>tcsh</tt>, etc), use:
<quote><tt>
make World &gt;&amp; World.log
</tt></quote>
You can follow the progress of the build by running:
<quote><tt>
tail -f World.log
</tt></quote> in a terminal. 

<p>
When the build is finished, you should check the <tt/World.Log/ file to
see if there were any problems.  If there weren't any then you can
install the binaries.  By default the "make World" process will ignore
errors and build as much as possible.  If there were problems and they
are not corrected at this stage, the installation process will fail.
To restart the build process after correcting the problems, just
run 'make'.  If Imakefiles or part of the build configuration was
changed as part of correcting the problem, either re-run "make World",
or run "make Everything".

If you would prefer "make World" to exit at the first error, run it in the
following way instead of the way described above:

for Bourne-like shells:
<quote><tt>
make WORLDOPTS= World &gt; World.log 2&gt;&amp;1
</tt></quote>
for C-shell variants:
<quote><tt>
make WORLDOPTS= World &gt;&amp; World.log
</tt></quote>

To do the install, run "<tt/make install/" and "<tt/make install.man/".
Make sure you have enough space in <tt>/usr/X11R6</tt> for the install
to succeed.  If you want to install on a filesystem other than
<tt>/usr</tt>, make a symbolic link to <tt>/usr/X11R6</tt> before
installing.


<sect>Reconfiguring the server (source distribution)
<p>
To build a different set of servers or servers with a different set of
drivers installed:
<enum>
<item>Make sure the source for any new drivers is in the correct place (e.g.,
driver source should be in a subdirectory of
<tt>xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/drivers</tt>).

<item>Change the settings of the server defines
in <tt/host.def/ to specify which servers you
wish to build.  Also, change the driver lists to suit your needs.

<item>From <tt>xc/programs/Xserver</tt>, run:
<tscreen><verb>
	make Makefile
	make Makefiles
	make includes
	make depend
	make
</verb></tscreen>
</enum>

<sect>Other useful make targets
<p>There are some other useful targets defined in the top level
<tt>Makefile</tt> of XFree86: 
<itemize>
<item><bf/Everything/ after a <tt>make World</tt>, <tt>make
Everything</tt> does everything a <tt>make World</tt> does, except the
cleaning of the tree. It is a way to quickly rebuild the tree after a
source patch, but it is not 100% bullet proof. There are cases were it
is better to force a full build by using <tt>make World</tt>. 


<item><bf/clean/ does a partial cleaning of the source tree. Removes
object files and generated manual pages, but leaves the Makefiles and
the generated dependencies files in place. After a <tt>make clean</tt>
you need to re-run 
<tscreen><verb>
        make includes
        make depend
        make
</verb>
</tscreen>
to rebuild the XFree86. 

<item><bf/distclean/ does a full cleaning of the source tree,
removing all generated files. After a <tt>make distclean</tt>,
<tt>make World</tt> is the only option to rebuild XFree86. 

<item><bf/includes/ generates all generated header files and in-tree
symbolic links  needed by the build. These files are removed by a
<tt>make clean</tt>. 

<item><bf/depend/ recomputes the dependencies for the various targets
in all Makefiles. Depending on the operating system, the dependencies
are stored in the Makefile, or as a separate file, called
<tt>.depend</tt>. This target needs the generated include files
produced by <tt>make includes</tt>. 

<item><bf/VerifyOS/ displays the detected operating system version. If
the numbers shown do not match your system, you probably need to set
them manually in <tt>host.def</tt> and report the problem to
<email>XFree86@@XFree86.org</email>.

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,

This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86

In most cases it shouldn't be necessary to configure anything before building.
d99 2
a100 23
If you do want to make configuration changes, it is recommended that
you start by going to the <tt>xc/config/cf</tt> directory, and copying
the file <tt>xf86site.def</tt> to <tt>host.def</tt>.  Then read through
the <tt>host.def</tt> file (which is heavily commented), and set any
parameters that you want for your configuration.  You can usually find
out what the default settings are by checking the <tt>.cf</tt> file(s)
relevant to your OS.

A general rule to follow is to only change things that you understand
and have a good reason to change.  It is easy to create build problems
by changing the default configuration.  Many of the configuration
parameters are documented in <tt>xc/config/cf/README</tt>.

From time to time there may be some stale links in the build tree, for
example, when files in the source tree are removed or renamed.  These can
be cleaned up by running the "<tt>cleanlinks</tt>" script from the build
directory (see the <htmlurl name="cleanlinks(1)" url="cleanlinks.1.html">
manual page).  Rarely there will be changes that will require the build
tree to be re-created from scratch.  A symptom of this can be mysterious
build problems.  The best solution for this is to remove the build tree,
and then re-create it using the steps outlined above.

When the build is finished, you should check the <tt/World.Log/ file to
see if there were any problems.  If there weren't any then you can
install the binaries.  By default the "make World" process will ignore
errors and build as much as possible.  If there were problems and they
are not corrected at this stage, the installation process will fail.
To restart the build process after correcting the problems, just
run 'make'.  If Imakefiles or part of the build configuration was
changed as part of correcting the problem, either re-run "make World",
or run "make Everything".

If you would prefer "make World" to exit at the first error, run it in the
following way instead of the way described above:

for Bourne-like shells:
<quote><tt>
make WORLDOPTS= World &gt; World.log 2&gt;&amp;1
</tt></quote>
for C-shell variants:
<quote><tt>
make WORLDOPTS= World &gt;&amp; World.log
</tt></quote>

To do the install, run "<tt/make install/" and "<tt/make install.man/".
Make sure you have enough space in <tt>/usr/X11R6</tt> for the install
to succeed.  If you want to install on a filesystem other than
<tt>/usr</tt>, make a symbolic link to <tt>/usr/X11R6</tt> before
installing.

           X312util.tgz
                 Lots of PD utilities provided as is.

           X312pex.tgz
                 All files relating to PEX including libraries and
                 header files.  The LinkKit is required to obtain
                 servers capable of running PEX.

To obtain a minimum XFree86 installation you will require the archives marked
with a `*' above, the server binary best suited to your machine and option-
ally "gunzip.Z".  All the files are compressed with "gzip" except of course
"gunzip.Z" which is compressed using the conventional compress program.

To install the XFree86 binaries just follow these steps.

  1.  Obtain the files you require.

      The rest of this procedure must be done as root.  If you do not run the
      extraction as root the permissions on the files will not be correct.
      For example,  the `X' server is s-bit root and will not function cor-
      rectly if extracted as an ordinary user.

  2.  create a directory /usr/X11R6, permissions 755 should do nicely.

  3.  cd /usr/X11R6

  4.  extract the archives, for example:

                       gunzip < X312bin.tgz | tar xvpf -

  5.  if you have installed man pages see the later section on setting up man
      pages.

  6.  Look through /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc/INSTALL, especially section 2 on
      configuring and using XFree86.   This should allow you to get a server
      up and running.  Before starting the server check in the later section
      Before Running XFree86 (section 3., page 1), in this document, to see
      if there are any system requirements you have to make for the server to
      operate correctly.

2.  Source Distribution

The SCO port comes as part of the standard XFree86 distribution.  Consult the
XFree86 README for more information on the location of sources.

Please note that as of XFree86 3.2, Only SCO Open Server Release 5 and
onwards are supported.  If you are using a previous version of SCO UNIX and
you want to use XFree86, use the 3.1 series, or be prepared for build fail-
ures.

For people who want and need to look around the source, there are now two
files in ``xc/config/cf''. Firstly, ``sco.cf'' is the old original SCO con-
figuration file, and ``sco5.cf'', which is the currently used configuration
file.

3.  Before Running XFree86

The SCO xterm terminfo description is not compatible with the xterm in the R5
distribution.

To use a Bus/Keyboard or PS2 mouse you should configure the mouse drivers
under SCO as above using 'mkdev mouse'. You may then use the OsMouse option
in your XF86Config to specify that XFree86 should use the SCO mouse drivers.
To do this, set the Protocol to "OsMouse" in the Pointer section of your
XF86Config file.  You can also use "OsMouse" for your serial mouse, espe-
cially if you are having trouble getting your mouse to work using the XFree86
mouse drivers.

If you do not have the SCO TCP/IP package installed do not panic.  XFree86
will work fine without TCP/IP but you will most likely have to do some or all
of these things:

   o Do not worry about errors from the X server complaining about
     ``/dev/socksys''.  The X server is configured to run on systems with and
     without TCP/IP.  This error is just pointing out that you do not have
     TCP/IP and that this method of connecting to the server has been dis-
     abled.

   o Do worry about errors involving ``/dev/spx'' or the ``sco'' connection
     type.  This means something is wrong with the streams pipes that are
     used for connections on the local machine.  First be sure that your
     server has the ``s-bit'' set.  You can do this by running this command
     for the X server you are using:

     ls -al /usr/X11R6/bin/XF86_XXXXXX

     The output should contain the `s' character instead of the `x' charac-
     ter.  For example:

               -rwsr-xr-x   1 root     bin      1074060 Jul 24 11:54 XF86_S3

     is correct while:

               -rwxr-xr-x   1 root     bin      1074060 Jul 24 11:54 XF86_S3

     is not.

   o you may have to install streams into the kernel with ``mkdev streams''
     Check the SCO Manuals for more information on this.

   o you may have to configure some devices in /dev,  check in the "Trouble
     Shooting" section of this document for the entry which comments on
     ``/dev/spx'' and ``Xsco''.

   o Your streams resources may be configured too low.  You should check your
     streams parameters against the following values,  if the are higher then
     you do not need to changes them.  To check these values, login as root,
     change directory to ``/etc/conf/cf.d'' and then run ``./configure''.

     Once you are running configure,  choose the ``Streams Data'' option and
     step through the entries.  Just press <ENTER> at each prompt unless you
     want to change a value.  The values to look for,  and their minimum val-
     ues, are:

                                  NSTREAM      128
                                  NQUEUE       512
                                  NBLK4096     4
                                  NBLK2048     32
                                  NBLK1024     32
                                  NBLK512      32
                                  NBLK256      64
                                  NBLK128      256
                                  NBLK64       256
                                  NBLK16       256
                                  NBLK4        128
                                  NUMSP        128

     You will not normally need to change any of these,  if however you do
     have to change some,  configure will confirm that you want to save the
     changes before exiting,  and will give you further instructions on
     rebuilding the unix kernel.

4.  Switching Consoles

XFree86 uses similar console switching keys as the SCO R4 and R5 servers.
That is, Ctrl-PrntScr takes you to the next console along from the one X is
running on.  If this is the last console it will take you to console 1. Ctrl-
Alt-FXX, where XX is a function key between F1 and F12 will switch you to the
console number assigned to that function key. F1 corresponds to tty01 (or
console 1), F2 corresponds to tty02 (or console 2) etc.  Those interested in
modifying the console switching should look in xc/pro-
grams/Xserver/hw/xfree86/common/xf86Events.c.

5.  Setting up Man Pages

After compiling the tree, or after installing the binary distribution you can
get man to recognise the XFree86 man pages by adding /usr/X11R6/man to the
MANPATH in /etc/default/man, the line should look similar to:

         MANPATH=/usr/man:/usr/X11R6/man

This allows all users to view the X man pages.  You may change your own MAN-
PATH environment variable if you do not want everyone to access the man
pages.

By default the man pages are compressed using ``compress'' to conserve space.
If you do not want to compress the man pages change CompressManPages to NO in
your ``xf86site.def'' file.  Those using the binary distribution can use
``uncompress'' to uncompress the man pages.

6.  Using SCO binaries/servers.

XFree86 will accept connections from SCO binaries (R3 upwards) and the SCO R5
server will also accept connections from XFree86 binaries. This means you may
mix and match the two if you have ODT.  For example you may still use the
Motif window manager (mwm) if you prefer.

7.  Compiling XFree86 under Open Server 5

As of GCC version 2.8.0, Open Server is supported. Configure it by using the
following:

         ./configure i486-sco3.2v5.0

There is no reason to modify gcc in any way.  It compiles cleanly on Open
Server 5.

SCO Open Server 5.0 is recognised automatically by XFree86. You do not need
to specify any BOOTSTRAPCFLAGS parameters when doing a make World. You can
ignore the warning message about BOOTSTRAPCFLAGS at the very beginning of a
make World.

  1.  Fine tune ``site.def/xf86site.def''

      Use GCC if you can. XFree should compile with the DevSys cc, but GCC
      has better optimizations, and is guaranteed to work.

  2.  SCO Open Server comes with Visual TCL, which is an old (and incompati-
      ble) version of TCL. If you want to use XF86Setup you will have to com-
      pile Tcl and Tk yourself. Both are supported well on SCO Open Server 5.
      Tcl 7.6 and Tk 4.2 are available from ftp://ftp.smli.com/pub/tcl.

  3.  You may want to disable dynamic loading support. Several users have
      reported trouble with this. XIE and PEX5 definitely do not work. If you
      want to experiment, try enabling this. Please report successes or fail-
      ures to me.

  4.  Do not enable the HasSVR3mmapDrv as you may have done in older versions
      of SCO. Open Server 5 has full mmap() support, and this is used for
      direct frame buffer access.

  5.  If you know you will not ever be using COFF binaries, and you are short
      of space, set ForceNormalLib to NO. Doing this will cause only the ELF
      versions of the libraries to be built.  ``sco5.cf'' sets this to YES by
      default, so you must explicitly set it to NO in ``xf86site.def''.  All
      binaries are compiled in ELF mode to reduce space.

8.  Relevant Documentation

Some relevant documentation for SCO Users and Developers can be found in the
following files.

      README
            the standard XFree86 README (/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc)

      README.SVR3
            Although a lot of this readme is based on Interactive a substan-
            tial proportion is still relevant.

      All of the VGA/Config documentation.
            /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc/VideoModes.doc and the README files for
            particular video cards.

9.  Known Problems

   o After running the server you may see some strange characters in your
     input to the shell.  This is due to some unprocessed scancodes and is of
     no concern.  This will be fixed in a future release.

   o Not all of the applications in /usr/X11R6/bin have been debugged.

10.  Trouble Shooting

      Problem:

                 The server does not start up,  and I cannot tell what
                 is going wrong as it did not print any error messages.

      Causes:

                 There can be any number of causes why the server
                 doesn't start.  The first step is to find out what the
                 server has to say.  To do this we have to catch the
                 error output of the server into a file.  This output
                 contains a log of what the server is finding/doing as
                 it starts up.  To get this output run:

                                     startx 2> /tmp/errs

                 The output of the server will now be in "/tmp/errs".
                 You should look through this output for possible prob-
                 lems,  and then check here in this document for any
                 references to the problems you are seeing.

      Problem:

                 The server starts up,  the screen goes blank,  and I
                 never see anything else.  It appears that my machine
                 has hung.

      Causes:

                 Again this can have many causes.  Most likely your
                 XF86Config is wrong.  You should be able to kill the
                 server by typing Ctrl-Alt-BackSpace,  if it is still
                 running.  If this does not restore your display then
                 you may have to drive your system blind.  Always keep
                 another login running at the shell prompt so that you
                 may switch to that screen and run commands even if you
                 cannot see anything on the screen.  Try these things,
                 usually in the order given:

                    o log out of the login where you started ``X'' and
                      then change consoles.  This will cause the SCO
                      screen switching code to try to reset the card.

                    o run ``vidi v80x25'',  this command will also try
                      to set your card into a viewable mode.

                    o shutdown the machine cleanly with ``shutdown'' and
                      try again.

                 When first trying to get XFree86 to run,  be sure to
                 use a simple setup.  Get 640x480 working first then
                 move on to higher resolutions.  Always trap the output
                 of the server as shown earlier.  Once you have the
                 valid clocks for your video card (as provided in the
                 server output),  hard code them into your XF86Config as
                 this will take some strain off your monitor during
                 XFree86 startup where it usually probes the various
                 clock frequencies.  Getting the ``X'' screen to appear
                 can be a painfully slow task.  Be patient and read as
                 much of the doco as you can handle.  You will get it to
                 work.

      Problem:

                                 Fatal server error:
                                 xf86MapVidMem:No class map defined for (XXXXX,XXXXX)

      Causes:

                   1.  Your system does not have the correct
                       /etc/conf/pack.d/cn/class.h, You can confirm this
                       by editing the file and looking for the string
                       "SVGA", if it is not there then you should re-
                       install this file from the "Extended Utilities"
                       diskettes provided with your OS.  If this is not
                       possible then installing the "dmmap" driver from
                       the distribution may allow the server to operate
                       correctly.

      Problem:

                 xf86install does not work.

      Causes:

                 You should not be running xf86install when using the
                 XFree86 server under SCO.  It is used for Interactive
                 (ISC) installations.

      Problem:

                 The server starts but the screen is not aligned cor-
                 rectly or is shaky and impossible to view.

      Causes:

                 This is most likely due to an incorrect XF86Config
                 setup.  Look for the files README.Config  Video-
                 Modes.doc (in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc with the binary
                 distribution).  These files explains how to fix up your
                 video modes.

      Problem:

              1.  Can only run a limited number of xterms.

              2.  xterm does not work but other programs like xclock do work.

      Causes:

                 Not enough or no pseudo ttys devices are present on
                 your system.  Run "mkdev ptty" and increase the number
                 of ptty's.

      Problem:

                 When running curses/termcap applications in an xterm
                 the output gets corrupted especially when scrolling.

      Causes:

              1.  You are running an original 1.3 distribution of XFree86.
                  Update to the latest version (3.2 or greater).

              2.  You have resized the window and not ran "eval `resize`"
                  before using your application.  The SCO operating system
                  does not support dynamic resizing of xterms fully so this
                  command must be run after resizing an xterm in order for
                  curses/termcap applications to operate correctly.

      Problem:

              1.  When starting X it dies with an error "Cannot access a
                  needed shared library".

              2.  When starting an X application is dies with the above
                  error.

      Causes:

              1.  You do not have the binaries installed in the correct
                  directory.  Check that they are in /usr/X11R6

              2.  You have upgraded to a new binary distribution which has a
                  new version of the shared libraries which are not compati-
                  ble with your old binaries.  To fix this you will need to
                  re-install the old shared libraries or recompile your
                  application against the new libraries.

      Problem:

                 When linking against the SCO motif library I get an
                 unresolved external for "XtDisplayStringConversionWarn-
                 ing" when using gcc.

      Causes:

                 The SCO library is compiled with limited length identi-
                 fiers.  To work around this add the following code to
                 your application when compiling under XFree86 with gcc
                 and SCO motif.

                          #ifdef SCO
                          void XtDisplayStringConversionWarnin(dpy, from, toType)
                              Display*  dpy;
                              String    from;
                              String    toType;
                          { XtDisplayStringConversionWarning(dpy, from, toType); }
                          #endif

      Problem:

                 The server fails to run and prints out a line similar
                 to:

                 XFree86: Cannot open /dev/spx for ???? listener: No
                 such file or directory

      Causes:

                 All SCO unix installations appear to have the Streams
                 pseudo tty driver installed, but not all the devices
                 are present.

                   1.  there should be a /etc/conf/pack.d/sp directory,

                   2.  /etc/conf/sdevice.d/sp should have a 'Y' in it.

                   3.  You need a file in /etc/conf/node.d which con-
                       tains something like:

                                    clone  spx       c    sp
                                    sp     X0S       c    127
                                    sp     X0R       c    126
                                    sp     X1S       c    125
                                    sp     X1R       c    124
                                    sp     X2S       c    123
                                    sp     X2R       c    122
                                    sp     X3S       c    121
                                    sp     X3R       c    120
                                    sp     X4S       c    119
                                    sp     X4R       c    118
                                    sp     X5S       c    117
                                 sp   X5R       c    116
                                    sp     X6S       c    115
                                    sp     X6R       c    114
                                    sp     X7S       c    113
                                    sp     X7R       c    112

                 if you don't have something like this (maybe called
                 "Xsco") then create one and that should fix your prob-
                 lem.  As far as I can tell the streams pseudo tty
                 driver should be there.

                 The simplest way to get the devices if you had to cre-
                 ate this file is to rebuild the kernel and the environ-
                 ment.  If you don't want to do this then:

                              touch /etc/.new_unix
                              cd /etc/conf/bin
                              ./idmkenv

                 and try it out.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

1.  Requirements
d9 1
a9 2
Before you can either compile or execute a binary distribution of XFree86,
the following conditions must be met:
d11 2
a12 72
   o Ensure that you are running Release 5.0.4 or later. This is required
     because OSS646 is only supported on those platforms. There are no plans
     to support XFree86 on earlier releases of OpenServer.

   o Ensure that OSS646, the ``Execution Environment Update'' package is
     installed, if appropriate.  Check the release notes for that update to
     see whether or not your current operating system requires this update.
     At least version OSS646B is required.  If you are running SCO OpenServer
     Release 5.0.7, you must have Maintenance Pack 1 installed.

   o Ensure that the "Graphics, Web and X11 Libraries" package is installed.
     At least version 1.3.2Ag is required.  You should always install the
     latest possible version of this supplement that is valid for your oper-
     ating system release.  From time to time this release is bundled with
     Maintenance Packs, so if you are running 5.0.7 or later, the latest ver-
     sion may be in the latest Maintenance Pack.  Always check the release
     notes for GWXLIBS to see if your platform requires the update.  The lat-
     est version can always be found at the SCO FTP site
     <URL:ftp://ftp.sco.com/pub/openserver5/opensrc>.

   o To compile XFree86, you must use the SCO-supported version of the GNU C
     Compiler.  It is possible that Skunkware versions of the compiler will
     work too, but this has not been tested.  The ``GNU Development System''
     is available for all releases from (and including) SCO OpenServer
     Release 5.0.5.  It is provided with the operating system in all versions
     from Release 5.0.7, although you need to run ``custom'' to install it
     from the media.  You can always download the latest latest version of
     the GNU Development System from the SCO FTP site
     <URL:ftp://ftp.sco.com/pub/openserver5/opensrc>.

   o If you are not using OSR 5.0.7 or later, you need to get an updated con-
     sole driver.  See <URL:http://www.sco.com> for details on OpenServer
     supplements.  If you can't or don't want to upgrade your console driver,
     XFree86 will still compile, but you may run into problems with some
     cards such as the Riva TNT and ATI Rage cards.  The problem with the
     console driver in 5.0.6A and earlier is that when the X server sets
     graphics mode, the driver does not set a status bit, so any text that is
     sent directly to /dev/console, such as kernel warning or notice messages
     when you access tape drives or NFS notices, will be sent to the console
     video memory.  This just happens to be slap bang in the middle of
     palette data for the Riva TNT, so you get color map corruption.  The
     updated console driver also has an improved mechanism for allocating
     video memory that XFree86 detects at compile time, and it will use it if
     it exists.  It is STRONGLY recommended that you get the console driver
     update.

2.  Compiling XFree86

Using the GNU Development System, compiling XFree86 should be fairly
straightforward.  Before attempting to compile the system though, you should
make sure that you have met all of the requirements above.  To actually start
the compilation, perform the following steps:

   o Copy the unmodified xf86site.def in xc/config/cf to host.def. Edit
     host.def and make any changes you think you need. The most useful
     options to change are HasTcl, HasTk, HasXdmAuth if you have the file
     WrapHelp.c and GccWarningOptions. Due to the nature of OpenServer's
     header files, the default options for this last setting are a bit
     aggressive, and I recommend you set this option to -Wpointer-arith.

   o Make sure that the official version of the GNU Development System is
     first in your PATH.  The official version lives in /usr/gnu/bin, and the
     Skunkware version (if any) lives in /usr/local/bin. You must ensure that
     /usr/gnu/bin appears first in your PATH.

   o Go to the top level of the source tree and execute the command CC=gcc
     make World BOOTSTRAPCFLAGS=-DSCO5 2>&1 | tee world.log.  This will do a
     full build, and send all of the build results to the file world.log.

   o If the build succeeded, install the new server by executing the command
     make install 2>&1 | tee install.log as root.  This will send the install
     results to the file install.log.
d14 114
a127 2
   o If you want to install the manual pages, execute the command make
     install.man 2>&1 | tee -a install.log as root.
d135 70
a204 5
using 'mkdev mouse'.  You may then use the OsMouse option in your XF86Config
to specify that XFree86 should use the SCO mouse drivers.  To do this, set
the Protocol to "OsMouse" in the Pointer section of your XF86Config file.
You can also use "OsMouse" for your serial mouse, especially if you are hav-
ing trouble getting your mouse to work using the XFree86 mouse drivers.
d213 3
a215 7
console 1), F2 corresponds to tty02 (or console 2) etc.

Unlike the SCO X server, the "kill me now" key is Alt+Ctrl+Backspace.  This
does not ask for confirmation, it simply kills the X server as immediately as
possible.  Use with extreme caution.  This may cause applications to termi-
nate in an unpredictable way.  You can set the DontZap option in the Server-
Flags section of your XF86Config file to disable this.
d221 1

MANPATH in /etc/default/man. The line should look similar to:
d223 1
a223 1
         MANPATH=/usr/man:/usr/gnu/man:/usr/X11R6/man:/usr/local/man
d231 2
a232 6
your ``host.def'' file.  Those using the binary distribution can use ``uncom-
press'' to uncompress the man pages.  Binary distributions contain pre-for-
matted versions of all man pages.  If you are compiling the server yourself,
you need to have the GNU Tools package installed to get groff, the GNU nroff
replacement, to format the man pages.  Use the manroff script to format the
manual pages yourself.

     installed.  This ships standard with release 5.0.7 and later, and is
     only required for 5.0.[456] users.  This package will be updated fairly
     frequently, and it us always suggested you have the latest possible ver-
     sion installed.  At some point in the future it may even update the

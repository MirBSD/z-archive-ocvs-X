<title> Information for S3 ViRGE Users
<author>The XFree86 Project Inc.
<date>19 Dec 2001

<toc>

<sect> Supported hardware
<p>
The s3virge driver in XFree86 &relvers; supports the S3 ViRGE, ViRGE DX, GX, GX2, MX, MX+, and VX chipsets.  It also supports Trio3D and Trio3D/2x chips.  A majority of testing is done on ViRGE DX chips, making them the most stable to date.  This release has some stabilization fixes for MX, GX2 and Trio3D, and XVideo support for MX and GX2.

This driver is moderately stable, however please use caution with any new install.  Please report any problems to
<email>XFree86@@XFree86.org</email>
using the appropriate bug report sheet. 

<sect>Features:
<p>

<itemize>
<item>Fully accelerated support for S3 ViRGE family video adapters
<item>uses linear frame buffer
<item>supports resolutions up to 2048x2048
<item>supports color depths of 8, 15, 16, 24.
<item>full use of video card memory for acceleration caching when visible framebuffer leaves extra memory
</itemize>

<sect>Configuration:
<p>

The driver auto-detects RAM size, RAMDAC and ClockChip. Do not bother putting 
these in your "Device" section. 

<sect>Documentation:
<p>

The driver has several supported options which are documented in the s3virge man
page.  Please refer to it for additional details about XF86Config options.

<sect>Support:

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

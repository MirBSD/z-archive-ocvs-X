@                     Release Notes for XFree86[tm] 4.4.0

                          The XFree86 Project, Inc

                              29 February 2004

                                  Abstract

     This document contains information about features and their status
     in XFree86 4.4.0.

1.  Introduction to the 4.x Release Series

XFree86 4.0 was the first official release of the new XFree86 4 series.  The
current release (4.4.0) is the latest in that series.  XFree86 4 represents a
significant redesign of the XFree86 X server.  Not all of the hardware
drivers from 3.3.x have been ported to 4.x yet, but conversely, 4.x has sup-
port for a lot of hardware that is not supported in 3.3.x.  Our Driver Status
document summarizes how the hardware driver support compares between 3.3.6
and 4.4.0.

XFree86 4.4 introduces an automatic configuration mechanism for the XFree86
server which makes it now possible to start XFree86 without first creating a
configuration file.  The initial automatic configuration support is targeted
towards Linux and FreeBSD and it is hoped that automatic configuration will
be supported on other platforms in future releases.

If you are running either  Linux or FreeBSD, try it out if you do not already
have a working XF86Config file.  If you want to customise things afterwards,
you can cut and paste the automatically generated configuration from the
/var/log/XFree86.0.log file into an XF86Config file and make your customisa-
tions there.

If you do not have any luck with automatic configuration, or you are using a
platform that is not currently supported, try one of the older methods for
getting started.

XFree86 comes with a graphical configuration tool called "xf86cfg", which
also has a text mode interface and can be used to create an initial configu-
ration file. It can also be used to customise existing configurations.

Next in the order of configuration preferences is to use the XFree86 server's
ability to create a starting configuration file.  Run as root:

     XFree86 -configure

and follow the instructions.

Finally, if all else fails, the trusty old standby text-based tool "xf86con-
fig" can also be used for generating X server config files.

At least one, and hopefully, all of these configuration options will give you
a reasonable starting point for a suitable configuration file.  With the
automatic mechanism you might even find that you don't need one!

If you do need to customise the configuration file, see the XF86Config manual
page.  You can also check the driver-specific manual pages and the related
documentation (found at tables below (section 3., page 1) also.

Before downloading  the binary distributions for this release, please have a
quick read through the Installation Document.  It may save you some time and
also help you figure out which of the binary releases you need.

The next section describes what is new in the latest version (4.4.0) compared
with the previous full release (4.3.0).  The other sections below describe
some of the new features and changes between 3.3.x and 4.0.  There are lot's
of new features, and we definitely don't have enough space to cover them all
here.

2.  Summary of new features in 4.4.0.

This is a sampling of the new features in XFree86 4.4.0.  A more complete
list of changes can be found in the CHANGELOG that is part of the XFree86
source tree.  It can also be viewed online at our CVSweb server
<URL:http://cvsweb.xfree86.org/cvsweb/xc/pro-
grams/Xserver/hw/xfree86/CHANGELOG?rev=HEAD>.

2.1  Video Driver Enhancements

   o Several stability issues with the support for the Intel 830M, 845G,
     852GM, 855GM and 865G integrated graphics chipsets have been fixed.
     Some limitations related to the driver's use of the video BIOS remain,
     especially for some laptops.

   o The nv driver for NVIDIA cards has been updated as follows:

        o Support added to the nv driver for the GeForce FX 5700, which
          didn't work with XFree86 4.3.

        o The driver now does a much better job of auto-detecting which con-
          nector of dual output cards the monitor is attached to, and this
          should reduce or eliminate the need for manual XF86Config over-
          rides.

        o The 2D acceleration for TNT and GeForce has been completely rewrit-
          ten and its performance should be substantially improved.

        o TNT and GeForce cards have a new Xv PutImage adaptor which does
          scaled YUV bit blits.

   o The SiS driver has seen major updates, including:

        o Support for 661/741/760 and support for 330 (Xabre).

        o Merged Framebuffer mode.

        o Support for DVI, and much more.

        o DRI for 300 series (300/305, 540, 630, 730) is supported again.

   o A new driver for several VIA integrated graphics chipsets has been
     added.

   o Various updates and bug fixes have been made to most other drivers.

2.2  Input Driver Enhancements

   o The mouse driver has some support on Linux and FreeBSD for auto-detect-
     ing which device node to use. This makes it unnecessary to supply this
     information in the XF86Config file in most cases.

2.3  IPv6 support

XFree86 4.4 supports IPv6, based on the code contributed by Sun Microsystems,
Inc. to X.Org. See X.org's document <URL:http://www.x.org/IPV6_Spe-
cific_Changes.html> for a detailed list of what these changes are and how
your system is affected by them.

2.3.1  Protocol names and aliases.

   o tcp is an alias for both IPv6 and IPv4 transports.

   o inet specifies IPv4 only.

   o inet6 specifies IPv6 only.

You can force the X server to only listen to IPv4 connections with the X
-nolisten inet6  command or you can force a IPv6 connection by setting DIS-
PLAY to inet6/host:0.

2.3.2  XDM

The IPv6 XDMCP code is not enabled by default on platforms that don't support
binding a IPv6 socket to a IPv4 address.

The XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 authentication scheme does not support IPv6 addresses
but a new release of the protocol, XDM-AUTHORIZATION-2 has been designed;
this though is yet to be  implemented.  By default XFree86 builds do not
enable the XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 code.

2.4  X Server and Extension Updates

   o The Mesa version used for OpenGL® 1.3 and DRI driver support has been
     updated to 5.0.2.

2.5  Client and Library Updates

2.5.1  Xterm

The user-visible changes to xterm since XFree86 4.3 are:

Bug Fixes:

   o Make signalInhibit resource work, i.e., disable the menu entries that
     would send signals to, or exit xterm.

   o Make cursor definition in tek4014 emulation work as originally imple-
     mented.

   o Modify translations for scrollbar so that one can use shifted pageup,
     wheel mouse, etc., while the mouse pointer is over the scrollbar.

   o Correct initialization of G1 character set mapping.

New Features:

   o Modify the predictable version of the generated logfile name to append
     the process-id rather than a random value.

   o Modify scroll-back and scroll-forw actions to accept an adjustment
     value, e.g.,

          scroll-back(1, page-2)

     to scroll back by 2 lines less than a page.

   o Add visualBellDelay resource to modify the length of time used for
     visual bell, for very slow displays or very fast computers.

Improved Locale Support:

   o modify uxterm script to strip modifiers such as "@@euro" from the locale
     setting before adding ".UTF-8".

   o Add logic to wide-character support which attempts to load fonts speci-
     fied by utf8Fonts subresources at startup.  The subresources have the
     same names as the fonts which they replace, e.g., font, font1, etc., so
     that the ISO-10646-1 fonts can be specified in the XTerm app-defaults
     file.

   o Improved performance with chinput application.

Improved Font Handling:

   o Document in xterm's manual page how to use XFree86 ":unscaled" keyword
     to suppress scaling of bold fonts.

   o Improved logic for deriving bold fontname from normal fontname.

   o Make double-width characters work with -u8 option.

   o Updated table of Unicode line-drawing characters.

   o Several fixes for rendering using Xft (option -fa):

        o Make height of TrueType fonts match ascent+descent.

        o Translate Unicode values (from UTF-8 output to xterm) for line-
          drawing to xterm's internal code, etc., since TrueType fonts gener-
          ally do not have either set of line-drawing glyphs.  xterm can draw
          these directly.

        o Pass 16-bit values rather than 8-bit values to xtermXftDrawString()
          to allow for wide-characters.

        o Use built-in line-drawing characters for Xft fonts.

        o Implement underlining.

   o Implement boldMode for wide-characters.

   o Modified to work with CJK double-width (bi-width/monospace) fonts.

Workarounds for Special Applications:

   o Add option -k8 and resource allowC1Printable to allow users of non-VTxxx
     character sets such as KOI-8 to treat the C1 control area (character
     codes 128-159) as printable rather than control characters.

   o Add configure option --enable-broken-st and resource brokenStringTerm to
     allow user to revert one part of the parsing table corrections.

   o Add configure option --enable-broken-osc and resource brokenLinuxOSC to
     accommodate scripts which do not distinguish between running in the
     Linux console and running in X.  Linux console recognizes malformed con-
     trol strings which start with an OSC, but are fixed-length, with no ter-
     minator.

   o Add configure option --enable-pty-handshake to allow one to compile-in
     support for the pty handshaking logic, and resource ptyHandshake to
     enable or disable it.  This feature is normally enabled.

Modified Resources:

   o Change color4 to "dodger blue", since this provides better contrast.

   o Remove color resources from XTerm.ad, leaving them only in XTerm-col.ad

   o Modify UXTerm.ad resource file to include "XTerm-color" rather than
     "XTerm", in case the latter file contains no color resource definitions.

   o Changed class of veryBoldColors to VeryBoldColors, since ColorMode is
     associated with boolean resources.

   o Changed classes of colorBDMode and similar resources that override col-
     ors when a video attribute is set to ColorAttrMode, to make them dis-
     tinct from ColorMode.  This avoids an unexpected rendering of reverse
     video, for example.

Modified terminfo/termcap entries:

   o Add indp and rin to terminfo entry.

   o Add le to termcap xterm-basic entry.  Though missing from older termcaps
     for xterm, some applications check for it.

   o Correct AF/AB strings in termcap for xterm-256color and xterm-88color
     entries.

2.6  I18N and Font Updates

   o FreeType2 updated to version 2.1.4.

   o The "freetype" X server font backend has been updated by the After X-TT
     Project <URL:http://x-tt.sourceforge.jp/> to include the functionality
     previously provided by the "xtt" backend, and to fix some bugs.  The
     "xtt" backend will be dropped in the next release in favour of the
     updated unified "freetype" backend.

        o The new "freetype" backend has the improved "very lazy" metric cal-
          culation method which enables super-fast loading of proportional
          CJKV fonts.

        o All of the servers, including xfs, Xnest, Xprt, Xvfb, the Cygwin-
          XFree86 server (as well as the XFree86 server) can handle the per-
          fect TTCap options.

   o The Compose file processing mechanism has been improved and made more
     flexible.  See the Xlib Compose  file support and extensions section
     below (section 5.20, page 1).

   o The Bitstream Vera TrueType fonts that Bitstream, Inc donated to the
     GNOME Foundation have been included with this release.

2.7  OS Support Updates

   o On Mac OS X, the appropriate backend drawing code is now dynamically
     loaded at runtime which reduces the X server's memory footprint.  In
     rootless mode, Apple's Xplugin library is used where available.  (Xplu-
     gin is included as part of Mac OS X on Panther.) With Xplugin, XDarwin
     provides identical performance to Apple's X11, including the following
     improvements over 4.3:

        o Added direct GLX rendering with thread support.

        o Faster 2-D drawing.

        o Added support for the Apple-WM extension so XDarwin interoperates
          with quartz-wm.

   o On Darwin, IOKit mode now uses shadowfb for much faster drawing.

   o Various GNU/Hurd support updates.

   o Experimental support added for GNU/KFreeBSD and GNU/KNetBSD systems.

   o SCO OpenServer support updates.  XFree86 4.4 now works on Release 5.0.7
     with Maintenance Pack 1, or on prior releases through Release 5.0.4.
     Please consult the README.SCO file for details.

4.  Known Problems

   o Known issues with this version of the SiS driver:

        o The driver will not work with upcoming laptops/notebooks with
          661/741/760 and 30xLV bridges as regards LCD output. This is due
          folks at SiS at the very moment writing an entirely new VBIOS for
          such machines whose data layout is not decided yet.  (This might
          affect machines with 650/740 as well within the next year.)

        o Xv does not work correctly in TV NTSC 1024x768 mode, if the overlay
          is very large (or full screen). The effect are flickering lines on
          the screen. This is a hardware problem. Do not use this mode for
          video.

        o YPbPr 720p output is blurry (at least at 1024x768; unknown for
          other modes). This is a driver problem; solution currently unknown.

   o We have received a late report that enabling DPMS support with the
     radeon driver can damage some Viewsonic monitors.  DPMS is usually dis-
     abled by default.  You can verify whether or not DPMS is enabled by run-
     ning 'xset q' from within your X session.

5.  Overview of XFree86 4.x.

XFree86 4.x has a single X server binary called XFree86.  This binary can
either have one or more video and input drivers linked in statically, or more
usually, dynamically, and in that manner load the video drivers, input
drivers, and other modules that are needed.

XFree86 4.4.0 has X server support for most UNIX® and UNIX-like operating
systems on Intel/x86 platforms, plus support for Linux and some BSD OSs on
Alpha, PowerPC, IA-64, AMD64, Sparc, and Mips platforms, and for Darwin on
PowerPC.  Support for additional architectures and operating systems is in
progress and is planned for future releases.

5.1  Loader and Modules

The XFree86 X server has a built-in run-time loader, which can load normal
object files and libraries in most of the commonly used formats.  The loader
does not rely on an operating system's native dynamic loader support and it
works on platforms that do not provide this feature.  This  allows  for the
modules to be operating system independent (although not, of course, CPU
architecture independent) which means that a module compiled on Linux/x86 can
be loaded by an X server running on Solaris/x86, or FreeBSD, or even OS/2.

A main benefit of this, is that when modules are updated, they do not need to
be recompiled for every different operating system.  The loader in version
4.4.0 has support for Intel (x86), Alpha and PowerPC platforms.  It also has
preliminary support for Sparc platforms.

The X server makes use of modules for video drivers, X server extensions,
font rasterisers, input device drivers, framebuffer layers (like mfb, cfb,
etc), and internal components used by some drivers (like XAA),

The module interfaces (both API and ABI) used in this release are subject to
change without notice.  While we will attempt to provide backward compatibil-
ity for the module interfaces as of the 4.0 release (meaning that 4.0 modules
will work with future core X server binaries), we cannot guarantee this.
Compatibility in the other direction is explicitly not guaranteed because new
modules may rely on interfaces added in new releases.

Note about module security

     The XFree86 X server runs with root privileges, i.e.  the X server
     loadable modules also run with these privileges.  For this reason
     we recommend that all users be careful to only use loadable modules
     from reliable sources,  otherwise the introduction of viruses and
     contaminated code can occur and wreak havoc on your system.  We
     hope to have a mechanism for signing/verifying the modules that we
     provide available in a future release.

5.2  Configuration File

The XFree86 server uses a configuration file as the primary mechanism for
providing configuration and run-time parameters.  The configuration file for-
mat is described in detail in the XF86Config(5) manual page.

The XFree86 server has support for automatically determining an initial con-
figuration on most platforms, as well as support or generating a basic ini-
tial configuration file.

5.3  Command Line Options

Command line options can be used to override some default parameters and
parameters provided in the configuration file.  These command line options
are described in the XFree86(1) manual page.

5.4  XAA

The XFree86 Acceleration Architecture (XAA) was completely rewritten from
scratch for XFree86 4.x.  Most drivers implement acceleration by making use
of the XAA module.

5.5  Multi-head

Some multi-head configurations are supported in XFree86 4.x, primarily with
multiple PCI/AGP cards.

One of the main problems is with drivers not sufficiently initialising cards
that were not initialised at boot time.  This has been improved somewhat with
the INT10 support that is used by most drivers (which allows secondary card
to be "soft-booted", but in some cases there are other issues that still need
to be resolved.  Some combinations can be made to work better by changing
which card is the primary card (either by using a different PCI slot, or by
changing the system BIOS's preference for the primary card).

5.6  Xinerama

Xinerama is an X server extension that allows multiple physical screens to
behave as a single screen.  With traditional multi-head in X11, windows can-
not span or cross physical screens.  Xinerama removes this limitation.  Xin-
erama does, however, require that the physical screens all have the same root
depth, so it isn't possible, for example, to use an 8-bit screen together
with a 16-bit screen in Xinerama mode.

Xinerama is not enabled by default, and can be enabled with the +xinerama
command line option for the X server.

Xinerama was included with X11R6.4.  The version included in XFree86 4.x was
completely rewritten for improved performance and correctness.

Known problems:

   o Most window managers are not Xinerama-aware, and so some operations like
     window placement and resizing might not behave in an ideal way.  This is
     an issue that needs to be dealt with in the individual window managers,
     and isn't specifically an XFree86 problem.

5.7  DGA version 2

DGA 2.0 is included in 4.4.0.  Documentation for the client libraries can be
found in the XDGA(3) man page.  A good degree of backwards compatibility with
version 1.0 is provided.

5.8  DDC

The VESA® Display Data Channel (DDC[tm]) standard allows the monitor to tell
the video card (or on some cases the computer directly) about itself; partic-
ularly the supported screen resolutions and refresh rates.

Partial or complete DDC support is available in most of the video drivers.
DDC is enabled by default, but can be disabled with a "Device" section entry:
Option "NoDDC".  We have support for DDC versions 1 and 2; these can be dis-
abled independently with Option "NoDDC1" and Option "NoDDC2".

At startup the server prints out DDC information from the display, and can
use this information to set the default monitor parameters, or to warn about
monitor sync limits if those provided in the configuration file don't match
those that are detected.

5.8.1  Changed behavior caused by DDC.

Several drivers uses DDC information to set the screen size and pitch.  This
can be overridden by explicitly resetting it to the and non-DDC default value
75 with the -dpi 75 command line option for the X server, or by specifying
appropriate screen dimensions with the "DisplaySize" keyword in the "Monitor"
section of the config file.

5.9  GLX and the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI)

Direct rendered OpenGL® support is provided for several hardware platforms by
the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI).  Further information about DRI can
be found at the DRI Project's web site <URL:http://dri.sf.net/>.  The 3D core
rendering component is provided by Mesa <URL:http://www.mesa3d.org>.

5.10  XVideo Extension (Xv)

The XVideo extension is supported in XFree86 4.x.  An XvQueryPortAttributes
function has been added as well as support for XvImages.  XvImages are XIm-
ages in alternate color spaces such as YUV and can be passed to the server
through shared memory segments.  This allows clients to display YUV data with
high quality hardware scaling and filtering.

5.11  X Rendering Extension (Render)

The X Rendering extension provides a 2D rendering model that more closely
matches application demands and hardware capabilities.  It provides a render-
ing model derived from Plan 9 based on Porter/Duff image composition rather
than binary raster operations.

Using simple compositing operators provided by most hardware, Render can draw
anti-aliased text and geometric objects as well as perform translucent image
overlays and other image operations not possible with the core X rendering
system.

XFree86 4.4.0 provides a partial implementation of Render sufficient for
drawing anti-aliased text and image composition.  Still to be implemented are
geometric primitives and affine transformation of images.

Unlike the core protocol, Render provides no font support for applications,
rather it allows applications to upload glyphs for display on the screen.
This allows the client greater control over text rendering and complete
access to the available font information while still providing hardware
acceleration.  The Xft library provides font access for Render applications.

5.11.1  The Xft Library

On the client side, the Xft library provides access to fonts for applications
using the FreeType library, version 2.  FreeType currently supports Type1 and
TrueType font files, a future release is expected to support BDF and PCF
files as well, so Render applications will have access to the complete range
of fonts available to core applications.  One important thing to note is that
Xft uses the vertical size of the monitor to compute accurate pixel sizes for
provided point sizes; if your monitor doesn't provide accurate information
via DDC, you may want to add that information to XF86Config.

To allow a graceful transition for applications moving from core text render-
ing to the Render extension, Xft can use either core fonts or FreeType and
the Render extension for text.  By default, Xft is configured to support both
core fonts and FreeType fonts using the supplied version of FreeType 2.  See
the section on FreeType support in Xft for instructions on configuring
XFree86 to use an existing FreeType installation.

The Xft library uses a configuration file, XftConfig, which contains informa-
tion about which directories contain font files and also provides a sophisti-
cated font aliasing mechanism.  Documentation for that file is included in
the Xft(3) man page.

5.11.2  FreeType support in Xft

XFree86 4.4.0 includes sources for FreeType version 2.1.4, and, by default,
they are built and installed automatically.

5.11.3  Application Support For Anti-Aliased Text

Only three applications have been modified in XFree86 4.4.0 to work with the
Render extension and the Xft and FreeType libraries to provide anti-aliased
text.  Xterm, xditview and x11perf.  Migration of other applications may
occur in future releases.

By default, xterm uses core fonts through the standard core API.  It has a
command line option and associated resource to direct it to use Xft instead:

   o -fa family / .VT100.faceName: family.  Selects the font family to use.

Xditview will use Xft instead of the core API by default.  X11perf includes
tests to measure the performance of text rendered in three ways, anti-
aliased, anti-aliased with sub-pixel sampling and regular chunky text, but
through the Render extension, a path which is currently somewhat slower than
core text.

5.12  Other extensions

The XFree86-Misc extension has not been fully ported to the new server archi-
tecture yet.  This should be completed in a future release.

The XFree86-VidModeExtension extension has been updated, and mostly ported to
the new server architecture.  The area of mode validation needs further work,
and the extension should be used with care.  This extension has support for
changing the gamma setting at run-time, for modes where this is possible.
The xgamma utility makes use of this feature.  Compatibility with the 3.3.x
version of the extension is provided.  The missing parts of this extension
and some new features should be completed in a future release.

5.13  xedit

Xedit has several new features, including:

   o An embedded lisp interpreter that allows easier extension of the editor.

   o Several new syntax highlight modes, and indentation rules for C and
     Lisp.

   o Flexible search/replace interface that allows regex matches.

   o Please refer to xedit(1) for more details.

5.14  Font support

Details about the font support in XFree86 4.x can be found in the
README.fonts document.

5.15  TrueType support

XFree86 4.x comes with two TrueType backends, known as "FreeType" backend
(the "freetype" module) and `X-TrueType' (the "xtt" module).  Both of these
backends are based on the FreeType library.  The functionality of X-TrueType
has been merged into the FreeType backend by the After X-TT Project for
XFree86 4.4.  Consequently, the old X-TrueType backend will be dropped as of
XFree86 4.5.

5.16  CID font support

Support for CID-keyed fonts is included in XFree86 4.x.  The CID-keyed font
format was designed by Adobe Systems <URL:http://www.adobe.com> for fonts
with large character sets.  The CID-keyed font support in XFree86 was donated
by SGI <URL:http://www.sgi.com>.  See the LICENSE document for a copy of the
CID Font Code Public License.

5.17  Internationalisation of the scalable font backends

XFree86 4.x has a ``fontenc'' layer to allow the scalable font backends to
use a common method of font re-encoding.  This re-encoding makes it possible
to uses fonts in encodings other than their their native encoding.  This
layer is used by the Type1 and Speedo backends and the `xfsft' version of the
TrueType backend.  The `X-TrueType' version of the TrueType backend uses a
different re-encoding method based on loadable encoding modules.

5.18  Large font optimisation

The glyph metrics array, which all the X clients using a particular font have
access to, is placed in shared memory, so as to reduce redundant memory con-
sumption.  For non-local clients, the glyph metrics array is transmitted in a
compressed format.

5.19  Unicode/ISO 10646 support

What is included in 4.x:

   o All ``-misc-fixed-*'' BDF fonts are now available in the ISO10646-1
     encoding and cover at least the 614 characters found in ISO
     8859-{1-5,7-10,14,15}, CP1252, and MES-1. The non-bold fonts also cover
     all Windows Glyph List 4 (WGL4) characters, including those found in all
     8-bit MS-DOS/Windows code pages. The 8-bit variants of the ``-misc-
     fixed-*'' BDF fonts (ISO8859-1, ISO8859-2, KOI8-R, etc.) have all been
     automatically generated from the new ISO10646-1 master fonts.

   o Some ``-misc-fixed-*'' BDF ISO10646-1 fonts now cover a comprehensive
     Unicode repertoire of over 3000 characters including all Latin, Greek,
     Cyrillic, Armenian, Gregorian, Hebrew, IPA, and APL characters, plus
     numerous scientific, typographic, technical, and backwards-compatibility
     symbols. Some of these fonts also cover Arabic, Ethiopian, Thai,
     Han/Kanji, Hangul, full ISO 8859, and more. For the 6x13 font there is
     now a 12x13ja Kanji extension and for the 9x18 font there is a 18x18ja
     Kanji/Han/Hangul extension, which covers all ISO-2022-JP-2 (RFC 1554)
     characters. The 9x18 font can also be used to implement simple combining
     characters by accent overstriking. For more information, read Markus
     Kuhn's UTF-8 and Unicode FAQ <URL:http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/uni-
     code.html>.

   o Mark Leisher's ClearlyU proportional font (similar to Computer Modern).

   o ISO 10646/Unicode UTF-8 Level 1 support added to xterm (enabled with the
     -u8 option).

   o Both the xfsft (the "freetype" module) and the X-TrueType (the "xtt"
     module) TrueType font backends support Unicode-encoded fonts.

5.20  Xlib Compose file support and extensions

A more flexible Compose file processing system was added to Xlib in XFree86
4.4.0.  The compose file is searched for in the following order:

  1.  If the environment variable $XCOMPOSEFILE is set, its value is used as
      the name of the Compose file.

  2.  If the user's home directory has a file named ".XCompose", it is used
      as the Compose file.

  3.  The old method is used, and the compose file is "<xlocaledir>/<locale-
      name>/Compose".

Compose files can now use an "include" instruction.  This allows local modi-
fications to be made to existing compose files without including all of the
content directly.  For example, the system's iso8859-1 compose file can be
included with a line like this:

     include "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/iso8859-1/Compose"

There are two substitutions that can be made in the file name of the include
instruction.  %H expands to the user's home directory (the $HOME environment
variable), and %L expands to the name of the locale specific Compose file
(i.e., "<xlocaledir>/<localename>/Compose").

For example, you can include in your compose file the default Compose file by
using:

     include "%L"

and then rewrite only the few rules that you need to change.  New compose
rules can be added, and previous ones replaced.

Finally, it is no longer necessary to specify in the right part of a rule a
locale encoded string in addition to the keysym name.  If the string is omit-
ted, Xlib figures it out from the keysym according to the current locale.
I.e., if a rule looks like:

     <dead_grave> <A> : "\300" Agrave

the result of the composition is always the letter with the "\300" code.  But
if the rule is:

     <dead_grave> <A> : Agrave

the result depends on how Agrave is mapped in the current locale.

5.21  Luxi fonts from Bigelow and Holmes

XFree86 now includes the ``Luxi'' family of Type 1 fonts and TrueType fonts.
This family consists of the fonts ``Luxi Serif'', ``Luxi Sans'' and
``Luxi Mono'' in Roman, oblique, bold and bold oblique variants.  The True-
Type version have glyphs covering the basic ASCII Unicode range, the Latin 1
range, as well as the Extended Latin range and some additional punctuation
characters.  In particular, these fonts include all the glyphs needed for
ISO 8859 parts 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 13 and 15, as well as all the glyphs in the
Adobe Standard encoding and the Windows 3.1  character set.

The glyph coverage of the Type 1 versions is somewhat reduced, and only cov-
ers ISO 8859 parts 1, 2 and 15 as well as the Adobe Standard encoding.

The Luxi fonts are original designs by Kris Holmes and Charles Bigelow from
Bigelow and Holmes Inc., who developed the Luxi typeface designs in Ikarus
digital format.  URW++ Design and Development GmbH converted the Ikarus for-
mat fonts to TrueType and Type 1 font programs and implemented the grid-fit-
ting "hints" and kerning tables in the Luxi fonts.

The license terms for the Luxi fonts are included in the file `COPYRIGHT.BH',
as well as in the License document.  For further information, please contact
<design@@bigelowandholmes.com> or <info@@urwpp.de>, or consult the URW++ web
site <URL:http://www.urwpp.de>.

     This document contains some information about features present in
     XFree86 4.2.1 and their status.

XFree86 4.0 was the first official release of the new XFree86 4 series.
XFree86 4.2.1 is the first update to 4.2.0, which is the latest full release
in that series.  XFree86 4 represents a significant redesign of the XFree86 X
server.  Not all of the hardware drivers from 3.3.x have been ported to 4.x
yet, but conversely, 4.x has some hardware support not present in 3.3.x.  Our
Driver Status document summarizes how the hardware driver support compares
between 3.3.6 and 4.2.1.  Please check there first before downloading 4.2.1.
d78 1
a78 12
The 4.0.1 release introduced a new graphical configuration tool, "xf86cfg",
and a text mode interface was added to it for the 4.0.2 release.  It is work
in progress, but definitely worth trying out.  The trusty old text-based tool
"xf86config" can also be used for generating X server config files.  In addi-
tion to these tools, we've been working on a configuration tool that is
built-in to the X server.  It is included in the release, and it works well
for some hardware.  To try it out, just run (as root) "XFree86 -configure".
Each of these configuration options will give you a reasonable starting point
for a suitable configuration file.  We've put some effort into documenting
the 4.2.1 config file format, and you can find that information in the
XF86Config manual page. Check that, the driver manual pages and the related
documentation for further information.

Before you go to download and install the binary distributions for this
release, please have a quick read through the Installation Document.  It may
save you some time and help you figure out which of the binary releases you
need.

The next sections describe what has changed in the update release(s) as well
as what is new in the latest full release (4.2.0).  The other sections below
describe some of the new features and changes between 3.3.x and 4.0.  There
are lot's of new features, and we definitely don't have enough space to cover
them all here.

Unlike XFree86 3.3.x where there are multiple X server binaries, each of
which drive different hardware, XFree86 4.2.1 has a single X server binary
called XFree86.  This binary can either have one or more video drivers linked
in statically, or, more usually, dynamically load the video drivers and other
modules that are needed.

XFree86 4.2.1 has X server support for most UNIX(R) and UNIX-like operating
systems on Intel/x86 platforms, plus support for Linux on Alpha, PowerPC,
IA-64, Sparc, and Mips platforms, and for Darwin on PowerPC.  Work on support
for additional architectures and operating systems is in progress, and is
planned for future releases.
d463 12
a474 16
The XFree86 X server has a built-in run-time loader, donated by Metro Link
<URL:http://www.metrolink.com>.  This loader can load normal object files and
libraries in most of the commonly used formats.  Since the loader doesn't
rely on an operating system's native dynamic loader support, it works on
platforms that don't provide this feature, and makes it possible for the mod-
ules to be operating system independent (although not, of course, independent
of CPU architecture).  This means that a module compiled on Linux/x86 can be
loaded by an X server running on Solaris/x86, or FreeBSD, or even OS/2.

One of the main benefits of this loader is that when modules are updated,
they do not need to be recompiled for every different operating system.  In
the future we plan to take advantage of this to provide more frequent driver
module updates in between major releases.

The loader in version 4.2.1 has support for Intel (x86), Alpha and PowerPC
platforms.  It also has preliminary support for Sparc platforms.

The X server configuration file format has been extended to handle some of
the new functionality.  The xf86config utility can be used to generate a
basic config file, that may require some manual editing.  The X server also
has preliminary support for generating a basic config file.  This is done by
running (as root) "XFree86 -configure".  Alternatively, the sample config
file XF86Config.eg that is installed in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11 may be used as a
starting point.  The xf86cfg utility can also be used to create a new config-
uration file or to edit an existing one.  The XF86Setup utility is currently
not usable, but work is continuing in this area.

The main changes are covered here, but please refer to the XF86Config(5) man-
ual page for more comprehensive information:

   o The Module section is used to load server extension modules and font
     modules, but not XInput drivers.  The .so suffix should no longer be
     specified with module names.  Options may be supplied for modules by
     loading the module via a SubSection instead of the usual Load keyword.
     The bitmap module is the only font module that is loaded by default.  No
     server extensions are loaded by default, but some are built-in to the
     server.  It is strongly recommended that the extension module containing
     a range of small miscellaneous extensions (extmod) be loaded because
     some commonly used things won't work correctly without it.  The follow-
     ing example shows how to load all the server extensions plus the Type1
     and TrueType fonts support, and a commented example that shows how to
     pass options to an extension (this one is for loading the misc exten-
     sions (extmod) with the XFree86-VidModeExtension disabled):

               Section "Module"

                   Load "dbe"
                   Load "record"
                   Load "glx"
                   Load "extmod"

                   Load "type1"
                   Load "freetype"

                 # SubSection "extmod"
                 #     Option "Omit XFree86-VidModeExtension"
                 # EndSubSection

               EndSection

   o Option flags have been extended and are now used more widely in the con-
     fig file.  Options flags come in two main types.  The first type is
     exactly like the old form:

                   Option "name"

     where the option just has a name specified.  The name is case insensi-
     tive, and white space and underscore characters are ignored.  The second
     type consists of a name and a value:

                   Option "name" "value"

     The value is passed transparently as a string to the code that uses the
     option.  Common value formats are integer, boolean, real, string and
     frequency.  The following boolean option values are recognised as mean-
     ing TRUE: "true", "yes", "on", "1", and no value.  The values recognised
     as FALSE are "false", "no", "off", "0".  In addition to this, "no" may
     be prepended to the name of a boolean option to indicate that it is
     false.  Frequency options can have the strings Hz, kHz, or MHz appended
     to the numerical value specified.

     Note: the value must always be enclosed in double quotes ("), even when
     it is numerical.

   o The ServerFlags section now accepts its parameters as Options instead of
     as special keywords.  The older keyword format is still recognised for
     compatibility purposes, but is deprecated and support for it will likely
     be dropped in a future release.  The DPMS and screen save timeout values
     are now specified in the ServerFlags section rather than elsewhere
     (because they are global parameters, not screen-specific).  This example
     shows the defaults for these:

                   Option "blank time"    "10"
                   Option "standby time"  "20"
                   Option "suspend time"  "30"
                   Option "off time"      "40"

     The new option AllowDeactivateGrabs allows deactivating any active grab
     with the key sequence Ctrl+Alt+Keypad-Divide and the new option Allow-
     ClosedownGrabs allows closing the conection to the grabbing client with
     the key sequence Ctrl+Alt+Keypad-Multiply. Note that these options are
     off by default as they allow users to remove the grab used by screen
     saver/locker programs.

   o The Keyboard, Pointer and XInput sections have been replaced by a more
     general InputDevice section.  The old Keyboard and Pointer sections are
     still recognised for compatibility purposes, but they are discommended
     and support for them may be dropped in future releases.  The old XInput
     sections are no longer recognised.  The keywords from the old sections
     are expressed as Options in the InputDevice sections.  The following
     example shows typical InputDevice sections for the core mouse and key-
     board.

               Section "InputDevice"
                   Identifier  "Keyboard 1"
                   Driver      "keyboard"
                   Option      "AutoRepeat" "500 5"
                   Option      "XkbModel"   "pc104"
                   Option      "XkbLayout"  "us"
               EndSection

               Section "InputDevice"
                   Identifier  "Mouse 1"
                   Driver      "mouse"
                   Option      "Protocol"   "PS/2"
                   Option      "Device"     "/dev/mouse"
                   Option     "SampleRate" "80"
               EndSection

   o The Monitor section is mostly unchanged.  The main difference is that a
     set of VESA modes is defined internally in the server, and so for most
     monitors, it isn't necessary to specify any modes explicitly in the Mon-
     itor section.  There is also a new Modes section that can be used to
     define a set of modes separately from the Monitor section, and the Moni-
     tor section may "include" them with the "UseModes" keyword.  The Monitor
     section may also include Options.  Options that are monitor-specific,
     like the "DPMS" and "Sync on Green" options are best specified in the
     Monitor sections.

   o The Device sections are mostly unchanged.  The main difference is the
     new (and mandatory) Driver keyword that specifies which video driver
     should be loaded to drive the video card.  Another difference is the
     BusID keyword that is used to specify which of possibly multiple video
     cards the Device section is for.  The following is an example for a
     Matrox card:

               Section "Device"
                   Identifier "MGA 1"
                   Driver     "mga"
                   BusID      "PCI:1:0:0"
               EndSection

   o The Screen sections are mostly unchanged.  The old Driver keyword is no
     longer used, and a mandatory Identifier keyword has been added.  The
     DefaultColorDepth keyword has been renamed to DefaultDepth.

   o A new section called ServerLayout has been added to allow the layout of
     the screens and the selection of input devices to be specified.  The
     ServerLayout sections may also include options that are normally found
     in the ServerFlags section.  Multiple ServerLayout sections may be pre-
     sent, and selected from the command line.  The following example shows a
     ServerLayout section for a dual-headed configuration with two Matrox
     cards, and two mice:

               Section "ServerLayout"
                   Identifier  "Layout 1"
                   Screen      "MGA 1"
                   Screen      "MGA 2" RightOf "MGA 1"
                   InputDevice "Keyboard 1" "CoreKeyboard"
                   InputDevice "Mouse 1"    "CorePointer"
                   InputDevice "Mouse 2"    "SendCoreEvents"
                   Option      "BlankTime"  "5"
               EndSection

     See the XF86Config man page for a more detailed explanation of the for-
     mat of the new ServerLayout section.

The config file search patch has been extended, with the directories /etc/X11
and /usr/X11R6/etc/X11 being added.  The full search path details are docu-
mented in the XF86Config manual page.

The following new X server command line options have been added:

     -depth n

          This specifies the colour depth that the server is run-
          ning at.  The default is 8 for most drivers.  Most
          drivers support the values 8, 15, 16 and 24.  Some
          drivers also support the values 1 and 4.  Some drivers
          may also support other depths.  Note that the depth is
          different from the ``bpp'' that was specified with previ-
          ous versions.  The depth is the number of bits in each
          pixel that are significant in determining the pixel's
          value.  The bpp is the total size occupied by each pixel,
          including bits that are not used.  The old -bpp option is
          no longer recognised because it isn't a good way of spec-
          ifying the server behaviour.

     -fbbpp n

          This specifies the bpp format to use for the framebuffer.
          This may be used in 24-bit mode to force a framebuffer
          format that is different from what the driver chooses by
          default.  In most cases there should be no need to use
          this option.

     -pixmap24

          This specifies that the client-side pixmap format should
          be the packed 24-bit format that was often used by the
          3.3.x servers.  The default is the more common 32-bit
          format.  There should normally be no need to use this
          option.

     -pixmap32

          This specifies that the client-side pixmap format should
          be the sparse 32-bit format.  This is the default, so
          there should normally be no need to use this option.

     -layout name

          This specifies which ServerLayout section in the config
          file to use.  When this option is not specified, the
          first ServerLayout section is used.  When there is no
          ServerLayout section, the first Screen section is used.

     -screen name

          This specifies which Screen section in the config file to
          use.  When this option is not specified, the first
          ServerLayout section is used.  When there is no Server-
          Layout section, the first Screen section is used.

     -keyboard name

          This specifies which InputDevice section in the config
          file to use for the core keyboard.  This option may be
          used in conjunction with the -screen option.

     -pointer name

          This specifies which InputDevice section in the config
          file to use for the core pointer.  This option may be
          used in conjunction with the -screen option.

     -modulepath path

          This specifies the module search path.  The path should
          be a comma-separated list of absolute directory paths to
          search for server modules.  When specified here, it over-
          rides the value specified in the config file.  This
          option is only available when the server is started by
          the root user.

     -logfile file

          This specifies the log file name.  When specified here,
          it overrides the default value.  This option is only
          available when the server is started by the root user.

     -scanpci

          This specifies that the scanpci module should be loaded
          and executed.  This does a scan of the PCI bus.

     -logverbose [n]

          This options specifies the verbosity level to use for the
          log file.  The default is 3.

The following X server command line options have been changed since 3.3.x:

     -verbose [n]

          This option specifies the verbosity level to use for the
          server messages that get written to stderr.  It may be
          specified multiple times to increase the verbosity level
          (as with 3.3.x), or the verbosity level may be specified
          explicitly as a number.  The default verbosity level is
          0.

     -xf86config filename

          This option has been extended to allow non-root users to
          specify a relative config file name.  The config file
          search path will be used to locate the file in this case.
          This makes it possible for users to choose from multiple
          config files that the the sysadmin has provided.

the XFree86(1) manual page.

multiple PCI/AGP cards.  However, this is an area that is still being worked

DGA 2.0 is included in 4.2.1, but is not implemented by all drivers.  Prelim-

vided.

Precision Insight <URL:http://www.precisioninsight.com> was provided with
funding and support from Red Hat <URL:http://www.redhat.com>, SGI
<URL:http://www.sgi.com>, 3Dfx <URL:http://www.3dfx.com>, Intel
<URL:http://www.intel.com>, ATI <URL:http://www.ati.com>, and Matrox
<URL:http://www.matrox.com> to integrate the GLX extension for 3D rendering
in an X11 window.  The 3D core rendering component is the Mesa
<URL:http://www.mesa3d.org> library.  SGI has released the sources to the GLX
extension framework under an open license, which essentially provides the
glue between the 3D library and this windowing system.  Precision Insight has
integrated these components into the XFree86 X Server and added a Direct Ren-
dering Infrastructure (DRI).  Direct Rendering provides a highly optimized
path for sending 3D data directly to the graphics hardware.  This release
provides a complete implementation of direct rendering support for the 3Dfx
Banshee, Voodoo3 and Voodoo5 graphics cards, as well as the Intel i810/i815
cards, ATI Rage 128, and Matrox G400.  Updated information on DRI compatible
drivers can be found at the DRI Project <URL:http://dri.sourceforge.net> on

If you prefer, you can configure XFree86 4.2.1 to use an existing Freetype2
installation by telling XFree86 not to build the internal copy and indicating
where that external version has been installed. Edit (or create) con-
fig/cf/host.def to include:

   o #define BuildFreetype2Library NO

   o #define Freetype2Dir /usr/local

Note that XFree86 assumes you'll be using a release FreeType no older than
version 2.0.1.  Early FreeType version 2 releases used a different header
file installation and aren't compatible with XFree86. Instructions for build-
ing and installing FreeType can be found in the INSTALL file included with
the FreeType release.

     manual page, that enables a integration of Xaw programs with the new
     window/desktop managers that allows for configurable themes.

   o Some new actions were added to all Xaw widgets, to allow more config-
     urable control of the widgets, and to allow setting resources at run
     time.

   o Since Xpm was integrated into XFree86, programs linked with the new Xaw
     library     will also link with Xpm. This allows for color background
     pixmaps, and also for shaped widgets.

   o The text widget is the widget that will present more changes. These
     include:
d684 1

        o Block cursor.
d686 2
a687 2
        o Compile time limit of 16384 undo/redo levels (that will automati-
          cally grow if the text is not saved when this mark is reached).
d689 1

        o Overwrite mode.
d691 1
a691 2
        o Text killed is inserted in a kill ring list, this text is not for-
          gotten, pressing M-y allows traversing the kill ring list.
d693 1
a693 69
        o International support for latin languages is available even if the
          international resource is not set. Users will need to properly set
          the locale environment to make complete use of this feature.

        o A better multiply interface is provided. Pressing C-u,<number>
          (where number can be negative) allows passing parameters for text
          actions.

        o Text can be formatted to have left, right, center or full justifi-
          cation.

        o Text indentation support is also available.

Bug fixes:

   o The simple menu widget geometry management code was improved to solve
     problems with menu entries not visible in the screen.

   o The form widget geometry code was changed to solve problems with integer
     round problems in the child widgets geometry when resizing the parent
     form widget.

   o Several bugs were fixed in the text code, while some code was rewritten
     from scratch.

5.14  Xpm

Version 3.4k of the Xpm (X pixmap) library is now integrated into XFree86.

5.15  xedit

Xedit have been changed to use most of the new features added to the new ver-
sion of the Xaw library, and some xedit only features were added. Emacs users
will find that several of the emacs key bindings work with the new version of
xedit. These include:

   o File name tab completion. Including a Emacs dired like window, that will
     be shown when there are more than one match, when C-x,d is pressed, or
     when a directory name is specified.

   o An unlimited number of files can be edited at the same time. Including
     multiple views of the same or different files.

   o The line number of the cursor position is always visible. It can also be
     customized to show the column number, the position offset and the cur-
     rent size of the file.

   o There is an autoReplace resource, that enables automatic text replace-
     ment at the time text is typed. This feature is useful to create simple
     macros, or to correct common spelling errors.

   o A fully featured ispell interface is also available. This interface is
     expected to provide most of the features of the terminal interface of
     the ispell program, with some extra features that include:

        o A compile time limit of 16 undo levels.

        o Terse mode switch.

        o Dictionary change.

        o The interface also checks for repeated words.

   o A first tentative to add programming modes was done. Currently, there is
     one mode:

        o C-mode: this mode is expected to be stable, and fully usable.

5.16  Font support

a705 3
XFree86 4.x comes with two TrueType backends, known as `xfsft' (the
"freetype" module) and `X-TrueType' (the "xtt" module).  Both of these back-
ends are based on the FreeType library.

5.23  Directory rearrangements
d980 2
a981 8
Some changes to the installed XFree86 directory structure have been imple-
mented for 4.x.  One important change is a modified search path for the X
server's XF86Config file.  The details of this can be found in the XF86Config
manual page.  The other main change is moving most of the run-time configura-
tion files to /etc/X11, with symbolic links in the old /usr/X11R6/lib/X11
location pointing to the new location.  Some run-time generated files are now
located under the appropriate subdirectories of /var, again with the relevant
symbolic links in the old location.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

                  Release Notes for XFree86[tm] 4.3.99.903

     XFree86 4.3.99.903 and their status.
d15 19
a33 45
XFree86 4 represents a significant redesign of the XFree86 X server.  Not all
of the hardware drivers from 3.3.x have been ported to 4.x yet, but con-
versely, 4.x has support for a lot of hardware that is not supported in
3.3.x.  Our Driver Status document summarizes how the hardware driver support
compares between 3.3.6 and 4.3.99.903.  Please check there first before down-
loading 4.3.99.903.

XFree86 4.4 introduces an automatic configuration mechanism for the XFree86
server.  This makes it possible to start XFree86 in a usable way without
first creating a configuration file.  The initial automatic configuration
support is currently targetted towards Linux and FreeBSD.  Automatic configu-
ration will be supported on other platforms in future releases.  If you're
running Linux or FreeBSD, try it out if you don't already have a working
XF86Config file.  If you want to customise things afterwards, you can cut and
paste the automatically generated configuration from the
/var/log/XFree86.0.log file into an XF86Config file and make your customisa-
tions there.  Runtime and dynamic configuration is planned for future
releases.

If you don't have any luck with automatic configuration, or you are using a
platform that it isn't currently supported on, try one of the older methods
for getting started.

XFree86 comes with a graphical configuration tool called "xf86cfg".  It also
has a text mode interface.  It can be used to create an iniital configuration
file, and to customise existing configurations.

Next in the order of configuration preferences is to make use of the XFree86
server's ability to create a starting configuration file.  To do this, just
run (as root):

     XFree86 -configure

and follow the instructions.

Finally, the trusty old text-based tool "xf86config" can also be used for
generating X server config files.

At least one of these configuration options will give you a reasonable start-
ing point for a suitable configuration file.  With the automatic mechanism
you might even find that you don't need one!  If you do need to customise the
configuration file, you can find it fully documented in the XF86Config manual
page.  Also check the driver-specific manual pages and the related documenta-
tion for further information.  References to this driver-specific information
can be found in the tables below (section 3., page 1).

The other sections below describe some of the new features and changes
between 3.3.x and 4.0.  There are lot's of new features, and we definitely
don't have enough space to cover them all here.
d46 1
a46 1
2.  Summary of new features in 4.4.0.
d48 1
a48 1
2.1  Video Driver Enhancements
d50 1
a50 4
   o Several stability issues with the support for the Intel 830M, 845G,
     852GM, 855GM and 865G integrated graphics chipsets have been fixed.
     Some limitations related to the driver's use of the video BIOS remain,
     especially for some laptops.
d52 2
a53 1
   o The nv driver for NVIDIA cards has been updated as follows:
d55 2
a56 2
        o Support added to the nv driver for the GeForce FX 5700, which
          didn't work with XFree86 4.3.
d58 1
a58 4
        o The driver now does a much better job of autodetecting which con-
          nector of dual output cards the monitor is attached to, which
          should reduce or eliminate the need for manual XF86Config over-
          rides.
d60 1
a60 2
        o The 2D acceleration for TNT and GeForce was completely rewritten.
          Performance should be substantiallly improved.
d62 1
a62 2
        o TNT and GeForce cards have a new Xv PutImage adaptor which does
          scaled YUV bit blits.
d64 1
a64 1
   o The SiS driver has seen major updates, including:
d66 1
a66 1
        o Support for 661/741/760 and support for 330 (Xabre).
d68 1
a68 1
        o Merged Framebuffer mode.
d70 1
a70 1
        o Support for DVI, and much more.
d72 1
a72 1
        o DRI for 300 series (300/305, 540, 630, 730) is supported again.
d74 1
a74 2
   o A new driver for several VIA integrated graphics chipsets has been
     added.
d76 1
a76 1
   o Various updates and bug fixes have been made to most other drivers.
d78 1
a78 1
2.2  Input Driver Enhancements
d80 1
a80 3
   o The mouse driver has some support on Linux and FreeBSD for auto-detect-
     ing the device node to use, making it unnecessary to supply this infor-
     mation in the XF86Config file in most cases.
d82 2
a83 1
2.3  IPv6 support
d85 3
a87 3
XFree86 4.4 supports IPv6, based on the code contributed by Sun Microsystems
to X.Org. See X.org's document <URL:http://www.x.org/IPV6_Spe-
cific_Changes.html> for a detailled list of the changes.
d89 2
a90 1
2.3.1  Protocol names and aliases.
d92 1
a92 1
   o tcp is an alias for both IPv6 and IPv4 transports.
d94 2
a95 1
   o inet specifies IPv4 only.
d97 2
a98 1
   o inet6 specifies IPv6 only.
d100 1
a100 3
You can force the X server to only listen to IPv4 connections with the X
-nolisten inet6  command.  Or you can force a IPv6 connection by setting DIS-
PLAY to inet6/host:0.
d102 2
a103 1
2.3.2  XDM
d105 2
a106 2
The IPv6 XDMCP code is not enabled by default on platforms that don't support
binding a IPv6 socket to a IPv4 address.
d108 1
a108 4
The XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 authentification scheme does not support IPv6
addresses. A new release of the protocol, XDM-AUTHORIZATION-2 has been
designed, but is not implemented yet.  Note that  by default XFree86 builds
do not enable the XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 code.
d110 2
a111 1
2.4  X Server and Extension Updates
d113 2
a114 2
   o The Mesa version used for OpenGL® 1.3 and DRI driver support has been
     updated to 5.0.2.
d116 2
a117 1
2.5  Client and Library Updates
d119 4
a122 1
2.5.1  Xterm
d124 1
a124 1
The user-visible changes to xterm since XFree86 4.3 are:
d126 3
a128 1
Bug Fixes:
d130 1
a130 2
   o Make signalInhibit resource work, i.e., disable the menu entries that
     would send signals to, or exit xterm.
d132 1
a132 2
   o Make cursor definition in tek4014 emulation work as originally imple-
     mented.
d134 1
a134 2
   o Modify translations for scrollbar so that one can use shifted pageup,
     wheel mouse, etc., while the mouse pointer is over the scrollbar.
d136 3
a138 1
   o Correct initialization of G1 character set mapping.
d140 1
a140 1
New Features:
d142 1
a142 2
   o Modify the predictable version of the generated logfile name to append
     the process-id rather than a random value.
d144 1
a144 2
   o Modify scroll-back and scroll-forw actions to accept an adjustment
     value, e.g.,
d146 1
a146 1
          scroll-back(1, page-2)
d148 1
a148 1
     to scroll back by 2 lines less than a page.
d150 1
a150 2
   o Add visualBellDelay resource to modify the length of time used for
     visual bell, for very slow displays or very fast computers.
d152 1
a152 1
Improved Locale Support:
d154 1
a154 2
   o modify uxterm script to strip modifiers such as "@@euro" from the locale
     setting before adding ".UTF-8".
d156 1
a156 5
   o Add logic to wide-character support which attempts to load fonts speci-
     fied by utf8Fonts subresources at startup.  The subresources have the
     same names as the fonts which they replace, e.g., font, font1, etc., so
     that the ISO-10646-1 fonts can be specified in the XTerm app-defaults
     file.
d158 1
a158 1
   o Improved performance with chinput application.
d160 1
a160 1
Improved Font Handling:
d162 2
a163 2
   o Document in xterm's manpage how to use XFree86 ":unscaled" keyword to
     suppress scaling of bold fonts.
d165 2
a166 1
   o Improved logic for deriving bold fontname from normal fontname.
d168 1
a168 1
   o Make double-width characters work with -u8 option.
d170 1
a170 1
   o Updated table of Unicode line-drawing characters.
d172 1
a172 1
   o Several fixes for rendering using Xft (option -fa):
d174 1
a174 1
        o Make height of TrueType fonts match ascent+descent.
d176 1
a176 4
        o Translate Unicode values (from UTF-8 output to xterm) for line-
          drawing to xterm's internal code, etc., since TrueType fonts gener-
          ally do not have either set of line-drawing glyphs.  xterm can draw
          these directly.
d178 1
a178 2
        o Pass 16-bit values rather than 8-bit values to xtermXftDrawString()
          to allow for wide-characters.
d180 1
a180 1
        o Use built-in line-drawing characters for Xft fonts.
d182 1
a182 1
        o Implement underlining.
d184 1
a184 1
   o Implement boldMode for wide-characters.
d186 3
a188 1
   o Modified to work with CJK double-width (bi-width/monospace) fonts.
d190 1
a190 1
Workarounds for Special Applications:
d192 1
a192 3
   o Add option -k8 and resource allowC1Printable to allow users of non-VTxxx
     character sets such as KOI-8 to treat the C1 control area (character
     codes 128-159) as printable rather than control characters.
d194 2
a195 2
   o Add configure option --enable-broken-st and resource brokenStringTerm to
     allow user to revert one part of the parsing table corrections.
d197 2
a198 5
   o Add configure option --enable-broken-osc and resource brokenLinuxOSC to
     accommodate scripts which do not distinguish between running in the
     Linux console and running in X.  Linux console recognizes malformed con-
     trol strings which start with an OSC, but are fixed-length, with no ter-
     minator.
d200 2
a201 3
   o Add configure option --enable-pty-handshake to allow one to compile-in
     support for the pty handshaking logic, and resource ptyHandshake to
     enable or disable it.  This feature is normally enabled.
d203 1
a203 1
Modified Resources:
d205 3
a207 1
   o Change color4 to "dodger blue", since this provides better contrast.
d209 1
a209 1
   o Remove color resources from XTerm.ad, leaving them only in XTerm-col.ad
d211 1
a211 2
   o Modify UXTerm.ad resource file to include "XTerm-color" rather than
     "XTerm", in case the latter file contains no color resource definitions.
d213 2
a214 2
   o Changed class of veryBoldColors to VeryBoldColors, since ColorMode is
     associated with boolean resources.
d216 1
a216 4
   o Changed classes of colorBDMode and similar resources that override col-
     ors when a video attribute is set to ColorAttrMode, to make them dis-
     tinct from ColorMode.  This avoids an unexpected rendering of reverse
     video, for example.
d218 1
a218 1
Modified terminfo/termcap entries:
d220 2
a221 1
   o Add indp and rin to terminfo entry.
d223 1
a223 2
   o Add le to termcap xterm-basic entry.  Though missing from older termcaps
     for xterm, some applications check for it.
d225 3
a227 2
   o Correct AF/AB strings in termcap for xterm-256color and xterm-88color
     entries.
d229 1
a229 1
2.6  I18N and Font Updates
d231 2
a232 1
   o FreeType2 updated to version 2.1.4.
d234 2
a235 5
   o The "freetype" X server font backend has been updated by the After X-TT
     Project <URL:http://x-tt.sourceforge.jp/> to include the functionality
     previously provided by the "xtt" backend, and to fix some bugs.  The
     "xtt" backend will be dropped in the next release in favour of the
     updated unified "freetype" backend.
d237 1
a237 3
        o The new "freetype" backend has the improved "very lazy" metric cal-
          culation method which enables super-fast loading of proportional
          CJKV fonts.
d239 1
a239 3
        o All of the servers, including xfs, Xnest, Xprt, Xvfb, the Cygwin-
          XFree86 server (as well as the XFree86 server) can handle the per-
          fect TTCap options.
d241 1
a241 3
   o The Compose file processing mechanism has been improved and made more
     flexible.  See the Xlib Compose  file support and extensions section
     below (section 4.20, page 1).
d243 1
a243 1
2.7  OS Support Updates
d245 1
a245 6
   o On Mac OS X, the appropriate backend drawing code is now dynamically
     loaded at runtime. This reduces the X server's memory footprint.  In
     rootless mode, Apple's Xplugin library is used where available.  (Xplu-
     gin is included as part of Mac OS X on Panther.) With Xplugin, XDarwin
     provides identical performance to Apple's X11, including the following
     improvements over 4.3:
d247 1
a247 1
        o Added direct GLX rendering with thread support.
d249 1
a249 1
        o Faster 2-D drawing.
d251 1
a251 12
        o Added support for the Apple-WM extension so XDarwin interoperates
          with quartz-wm.

   o On Darwin, IOKit mode now uses shadowfb for much faster drawing.

   o Various GNU/Hurd support updates.

   o Experimental support added for GNU/KFreeBSD and GNU/KNetBSD systems.

   o SCO OpenServer support updates.  XFree86 4.4 now works on Release 5.0.7
     with Maintenance Pack 1, or on prior releases through Release 5.0.4.
     Please consult the README.SCO file for details.

4.  Overview of XFree86 4.x.

XFree86 4.x has a single X server binary called XFree86.  This binary can
either have one or more video and input drivers linked in statically, or,
more usually, dynamically load the video drivers, input drivers, and other
d349 16
a364 17
XFree86 4.3.99.903 has X server support for most UNIX® and UNIX-like operat-
ing systems on Intel/x86 platforms, plus support for Linux and some BSD OSs
on Alpha, PowerPC, IA-64, AMD64, Sparc, and Mips platforms, and for Darwin on
PowerPC.  Work on support for additional architectures and operating systems
is in progress, and is planned for future releases.

4.1  Loader and Modules

The XFree86 X server has a built-in run-time loader developed from code
donated by Metro Link <URL:http://www.metrolink.com>.  This loader can load
normal object files and libraries in most of the commonly used formats.
Since the loader doesn't rely on an operating system's native dynamic loader
support, it works on platforms that don't provide this feature, and makes it
possible for the modules to be operating system independent (although not, of
course, independent of CPU architecture).  This means that a module compiled
on Linux/x86 can be loaded by an X server running on Solaris/x86, or FreeBSD,
or even OS/2.
d367 3
a369 1
they do not need to be recompiled for every different operating system.
d371 2
a372 2
The loader in version 4.3.99.903 has support for Intel (x86), Alpha and Pow-
erPC platforms.  It also has preliminary support for Sparc platforms.
d378 4
a381 6
The module interfaces (API and ABI) used in this release is subject to change
without notice.  While we will attempt to provide backward compatibility for
the module interfaces as of the 4.0 release (meaning that 4.0 modules will
work with future core X server binaries), we cannot guarantee this.  Compati-
bility in the other direction is explicitly not guaranteed because new mod-
ules may rely on interfaces added in new releases.

4.2  Configuration File

The XFree86 server uses a configuration file as the primary mechanism for
providing configuration and run-time parameters.  The configuration file for-
mat is described in detail in the XF86Config(5) manual page.

The XFree86 server has support for automatically determining an initial con-
figuration on most platforms, as well as support or generating a basic ini-
tial configuration file.

4.3  Command Line Options

Command line options can be used to override some default parameters and
parameters provided in the configuration file.  These command line options
are described in the XFree86(1) manual page.

can be found in the XDGA(3) man page.  A good degree of backwards compatibil-
ity with version 1.0 is provided.

ularly the supported screen resolutions and refresh rates.

XFree86 4.x comes with two TrueType backends, known as "FreeType" backend
(the "freetype" module) and `X-TrueType' (the "xtt" module).  Both of these
backends are based on the FreeType library.  The functionality of X-TrueType
has been merged into the FreeType backend by the After X-TT Project for
XFree86 4.4.  Consequently, the old X-TrueType backend will be dropped as of
XFree86 4.5.

4.20  Xlib Compose file support and extensions

A more flexible Compose file processing system was added to Xlib in XFree86
4.4.0.  The compose file is searched for in the following order:

  1.  If the environment variable $XCOMPOSEFILE is set, its value is used as
      the name of the Compose file.

  2.  If the user's home direcotry has a file named ".XCompose", it is used
      as the Compose file.

  3.  The old method is used, and the compose file is "<xlocaledir>/<locale-
      name>/Compose".

Compose files can now use an "include" instruction.  This allows local modi-
fications to be made to existing compose files without including all of the
content directly.  For example, the system's iso8859-1 compose file can be
included with a line like this:

     include "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/iso8859-1/Compose"

There are two substitutions that can be made in the file name of the include
instruction.  %H expands to the user's home directory (the $HOME environment
variable), and %L expands to the name of the locale specific Compose file
(i.e., "<xlocaledir>/<localename>/Compose").

For example, you can include in your compose file the default Compose file by
using:

     include "%L"

and then rewrite only the few rules that you need to change.  New compose
rules can be added, and previous ones replaced.

Finally, it is no longer necessary to specify in the right part of a rule a
locale encoded string in addition to the keysym name.  If the string is
opmitted, Xlib figures it out from the keysym according to the current
locale.  I.e., if a rule looks like:

     <dead_grave> <A> : "\300" Agrave

the result of the composition is always the letter with the "\300" code.  But
if the rule is:

     <dead_grave> <A> : Agrave

the result depends on how Agrave is mapped in the current locale.

     This document contains information about features and their status
     in XFree86 4.4.0.

a20 7
XFree86 4.0 was the first official release of the new XFree86 4 series.  The
current release (4.4.0) is the latest in that series.  XFree86 4 represents a
significant redesign of the XFree86 X server.  Not all of the hardware
drivers from 3.3.x have been ported to 4.x yet, but conversely, 4.x has sup-
port for a lot of hardware that is not supported in 3.3.x.  Our Driver Status
document summarizes how the hardware driver support compares between 3.3.6
and 4.4.0.

server which makes it now possible to start XFree86 without first creating a
configuration file.  The initial automatic configuration support is targeted
towards Linux and FreeBSD and it is hoped that automatic configuration will
be supported on other platforms in future releases.

If you are running either  Linux or FreeBSD, try it out if you do not already
have a working XF86Config file.  If you want to customise things afterwards,
you can cut and paste the automatically generated configuration from the
d31 2
a32 1
tions there.
d34 11
a44 10
If you do not have any luck with automatic configuration, or you are using a
platform that is not currently supported, try one of the older methods for
getting started.

XFree86 comes with a graphical configuration tool called "xf86cfg", which
also has a text mode interface and can be used to create an initial configu-
ration file. It can also be used to customise existing configurations.

Next in the order of configuration preferences is to use the XFree86 server's
ability to create a starting configuration file.  Run as root:
d50 2
a51 2
Finally, if all else fails, the trusty old standby text-based tool "xf86con-
fig" can also be used for generating X server config files.
d53 16
a68 17
At least one, and hopefully, all of these configuration options will give you
a reasonable starting point for a suitable configuration file.  With the
automatic mechanism you might even find that you don't need one!

If you do need to customise the configuration file, see the XF86Config manual
page.  You can also check the driver-specific manual pages and the related
documentation (found at tables below (section 3., page 1) also.

Before downloading  the binary distributions for this release, please have a
quick read through the Installation Document.  It may save you some time and
also help you figure out which of the binary releases you need.

The next section describes what is new in the latest version (4.4.0) compared
with the previous full release (4.3.0).  The other sections below describe
some of the new features and changes between 3.3.x and 4.0.  There are lot's
of new features, and we definitely don't have enough space to cover them all
here.

This is a sampling of the new features in XFree86 4.4.0.  A more complete
list of changes can be found in the CHANGELOG that is part of the XFree86
source tree.  It can also be viewed online at our CVSweb server

        o The driver will not work with upcoming laptops/notebooks with
          661/741/760 and 30xLV bridges as regards LCD output. This is due
          folks at SiS at the very moment writing an entirely new VBIOS for
          such machines whose data layout is not decided yet.  (This might
          affect machines with 650/740 as well within the next year.)

        o Xv does not work correctly in TV NTSC 1024x768 mode, if the overlay
          is very large (or full screen). The effect are flickering lines on
          the screen. This is a hardware problem. Do not use this mode for
          video.

        o YPbPr 720p output is blurry (at least at 1024x768; unknown for
          other modes). This is a driver problem; solution currently unknown.

   o We have received a late report that enabling DPMS support with the
     radeon driver can damage some Viewsonic monitors.  DPMS is usually dis-
     abled by default.  You can verify whether or not DPMS is enabled by run-
     ning 'xset q' from within your X session.

5.  Overview of XFree86 4.x.

XFree86 4.x has a single X server binary called XFree86.  This binary can
either have one or more video and input drivers linked in statically, or more
usually, dynamically, and in that manner load the video drivers, input
drivers, and other modules that are needed.

XFree86 4.4.0 has X server support for most UNIX® and UNIX-like operating
systems on Intel/x86 platforms, plus support for Linux and some BSD OSs on
Alpha, PowerPC, IA-64, AMD64, Sparc, and Mips platforms, and for Darwin on
PowerPC.  Support for additional architectures and operating systems is in
progress and is planned for future releases.

5.1  Loader and Modules

The XFree86 X server has a built-in run-time loader, which can load normal
object files and libraries in most of the commonly used formats.  The loader
does not rely on an operating system's native dynamic loader support and it
works on platforms that do not provide this feature.  This  allows  for the
modules to be operating system independent (although not, of course, CPU
architecture independent) which means that a module compiled on Linux/x86 can
be loaded by an X server running on Solaris/x86, or FreeBSD, or even OS/2.

A main benefit of this, is that when modules are updated, they do not need to
be recompiled for every different operating system.  The loader in version
4.4.0 has support for Intel (x86), Alpha and PowerPC platforms.  It also has
preliminary support for Sparc platforms.
d455 6
a460 6
The module interfaces (both API and ABI) used in this release are subject to
change without notice.  While we will attempt to provide backward compatibil-
ity for the module interfaces as of the 4.0 release (meaning that 4.0 modules
will work with future core X server binaries), we cannot guarantee this.
Compatibility in the other direction is explicitly not guaranteed because new
modules may rely on interfaces added in new releases.

and a text mode interface was added to it for the 4.0.2 release.  It is the
preferred configuration tool provided by with XFree86.  The trusty old text-
based tool "xf86config" can also be used for generating X server config
files.  In addition to these tools, the XFree86 server has some built in
capabilities for generating a base config file.  This works well for most
hardware, and in most cases is the easiest way to get an initial config file.
To try it out, just run (as root):

XF86Config manual page.  Check there and the driver-specific manual pages and
the related documentation for further information.  References to this
driver-specific information can be found in the tables below (section 3.,
page 1).

We have plans to make the configuration file optional in a future release.
The XFree86 server is close to being able to automatically determine a com-
plete base configuration for most popular hardware configurations.

The next section describes what is new in the latest version (4.3.0) compared
with the previous full release (4.2.0).  The other sections below describe
some of the new features and changes between 3.3.x and 4.0.  There are lot's
of new features, and we definitely don't have enough space to cover them all
here.

2.  Summary of new features in 4.3.0.
d132 1
a132 1
2.1  Video Driver Enhancements
d134 1
a134 3
   o  ATI Radeon 9x00 2D support added, and 3D support added for the Radeon
     8500, 9000, 9100, and M9.  The 3D support for the Radeon now includes
     hardware TCL.
d136 3
a138 3
   o  Support added to the i810 driver for Intel 845G, 852GM, 855GM and 865G
     integrated graphics chipsets, including 2D, 3D (DRI) and XVideo.  Sup-

d144 1
a144 3
   o  Major SiS driver updates for some of the latest chipsets.  Unfortu-
     nately the SiS 3D driver has had to be disabled because no one has yet
     taken up the challenge to port it to Mesa 4.x.
d146 1
a146 2

2.3  X Server and Extension Updates
d165 2
a166 3
   o  Support for the RandR extension has been partially integrated into the
     XFree86 server, providing support for resizing the root window at run-
     time.
d168 1
a168 2
   o  The Mesa version used for OpenGL® 1.3 and DRI driver support has been
     updated to 4.0.4.
d170 1
a170 4
   o  The XFree86 server's hot keys (including those for switching modes and
     virtual terminals) can now be configured via XKB.  Previously they were
     hard coded.  An X server configuration option has been added to allow
     the VT switching hot keys to be disabled.
d172 1
a172 1
2.4  Client and Library Updates
d174 1
a174 3
   o  An Xcursor library providing support for alpha blended (ARGB) and ani-
     mated cursors.  Two Xcursor themes are provided (redglass and white-
     glass), as well as the default "core" theme (the traditional cursors).
d176 1
a176 1
   o  Xterm updated to patch level 173, including the following bugfixes:
d178 1
a178 2
        o  Fix two infinite loops (special cases of mouse hilite tracking,
          DECUDK parsing).
d180 1
a180 1
        o  Make repainting of the 256-color example work properly.
d182 1
a182 2
        o  Modify parser tables to improve detection of malformed control
          sequences, making xterm behave more like a real DEC terminal.
d184 1
a184 2
        o  Fix a problem with the blinking cursor which occasionally caused
          xterm to pause until a key was pressed.
d186 3
a188 1
        o  Fix improper parsing of multiple items in the ttyModes resource.
d190 1
a190 1
     and the following improvements:
d192 1
a192 1
        o  Modify xterm to invoke luit.
d194 2
a195 1
        o  Add simple session management client capabilities.
d197 2
a198 2
        o  Add a modifyCursorKeys resource to control how the shift- and sim-
          ilar modifiers are used to make a cursor escape sequence.
d200 2
a201 2
        o  Check if the printerCommand resource string is empty, and use this
          to allow the user to disable printer function.
d203 1
a203 2
        o  Sort the options list which is displayed in help- and syntax-mes-
          sages at runtime to simplify maintenance.
d205 3
a207 1
2.5  I18N and Font Updates
d209 1
a209 1
   o  FreeType2 updated to version 2.1.1.
d211 1
a211 4
   o  The "freetype" X server font backend has undergone a partial rewrite.
     The new version is based on FreeType 2, and handles TrueType (including
     OpenType/TTF), OpenType/CFF and Type 1 fonts.  The old "type1" backend
     is now deprecated, and is only used for CIDFonts by default.
d213 2
a214 2
   o  A new utility called "mkfontscale", which builds fonts.scale files, has
     been added.
d216 1
a216 5
   o  The Xft library has undergone a major restructuring, and is now split
     into fontconfig (which deals with font discovery and configuration and
     is independent from X), and Xft itself (which uses fontconfig and deals
     with font rasterisation and rendering.  The format of the Xft font con-
     figuration files has changed in an incompatible manner.
d218 1
a218 3
   o  Support has been added to the Xft library to do rendering with the core
     X11 protocol.  This allows clients using this library to render to X
     servers that don't have support for the RENDER extension.
d220 2
a221 4
   o  There has been a significant reworking of the XKB support to allow
     multi-layout configurations.  Multi-layout configurations provide a
     flexible way of supporting multiple language layouts and switching
     between them.
d223 1
a223 1
2.6  OS Support Updates
d225 3
a227 1
   o  Updates for Darwin/Mac OS X, including:
d229 1
a229 1
        o  Indirect GLX acceleration added.
d231 2
a232 1
        o  Smaller memory footprint and faster 2-D drawing in rootless mode.
d234 2
a235 1
        o  Full screen mode now uses shadowfb for much faster 2-D drawing.
d237 1
a237 1
        o  Native fonts can be used on MacOS X.
d239 1
a239 2
   o  Various Cygwin support updates, including an experimental rootless X
     server for Cygwin/XFree86.
d241 1
a241 1
   o  AMD x86-64 support (primarily for Linux so far) has been added.
d243 1
a243 1
   o  Support added for OpenBSD/sparc64.
d245 1
a245 1
   o  Major OS/2 support updates.

     XFree86 4.3.99.903 and their status.
d14 16
a29 31
XFree86 4.0 was the first official release of the new XFree86 4 series.
XFree86 4 represents a significant redesign of the XFree86 X server.  Not all
of the hardware drivers from 3.3.x have been ported to 4.x yet, but con-
versely, 4.x has support for a lot of hardware that is not supported in
3.3.x.  Our Driver Status document summarizes how the hardware driver support
compares between 3.3.6 and 4.3.99.903.  Please check there first before down-
loading 4.3.99.903.

XFree86 4.4 introduces an automatic configuration mechanism for the XFree86
server.  This makes it possible to start XFree86 in a usable way without
first creating a configuration file.  The initial automatic configuration
support is currently targetted towards Linux and FreeBSD.  Automatic configu-
ration will be supported on other platforms in future releases.  If you're
running Linux or FreeBSD, try it out if you don't already have a working
XF86Config file.  If you want to customise things afterwards, you can cut and
paste the automatically generated configuration from the
/var/log/XFree86.0.log file into an XF86Config file and make your customisa-
tions there.  Runtime and dynamic configuration is planned for future
releases.

If you don't have any luck with automatic configuration, or you are using a
platform that it isn't currently supported on, try one of the older methods
for getting started.

XFree86 comes with a graphical configuration tool called "xf86cfg".  It also
has a text mode interface.  It can be used to create an iniital configuration
file, and to customise existing configurations.

Next in the order of configuration preferences is to make use of the XFree86
server's ability to create a starting configuration file.  To do this, just
run (as root):
d33 11
a43 12
and follow the instructions.

Finally, the trusty old text-based tool "xf86config" can also be used for
generating X server config files.

At least one of these configuration options will give you a reasonable start-
ing point for a suitable configuration file.  With the automatic mechanism
you might even find that you don't need one!  If you do need to customise the
configuration file, you can find it fully documented in the XF86Config manual
page.  Also check the driver-specific manual pages and the related documenta-
tion for further information.  References to this driver-specific information
can be found in the tables below (section 3., page 1).

The other sections below describe some of the new features and changes
between 3.3.x and 4.0.  There are lot's of new features, and we definitely
don't have enough space to cover them all here.
d56 1
a56 1
2.  Summary of new features in 4.4.0.
d60 3
a62 6
   o Several stability issues with the support for the Intel 830M, 845G,
     852GM, 855GM and 865G integrated graphics chipsets have been fixed.
     Some limitations related to the driver's use of the video BIOS remain,
     especially for some laptops.

   o The nv driver for NVIDIA cards has been updated as follows:
d64 3
a66 2
        o Support added to the nv driver for the GeForce FX 5700, which
          didn't work with XFree86 4.3.
d68 2
a69 4
        o The driver now does a much better job of autodetecting which con-
          nector of dual output cards the monitor is attached to, which
          should reduce or eliminate the need for manual XF86Config over-
          rides.
d71 2
a72 2
        o The 2D acceleration for TNT and GeForce was completely rewritten.
          Performance should be substantiallly improved.
d74 3
a76 2
        o TNT and GeForce cards have a new Xv PutImage adaptor which does
          scaled YUV bit blits.
d78 2
a79 1
   o The SiS driver has seen major updates, including:
d81 2
a82 1
        o Support for 661/741/760 and support for 330 (Xabre).
d84 1
a84 1
        o Merged Framebuffer mode.
d86 1
a86 1
        o Support for DVI, and much more.
d88 1
a88 6
        o DRI for 300 series (300/305, 540, 630, 730) is supported again.

   o A new driver for several VIA integrated graphics chipsets has been
     added.

   o Various updates and bug fixes have been made to most other drivers.
d92 1
a92 47
   o The mouse driver has some support on Linux and FreeBSD for auto-detect-
     ing the device node to use, making it unnecessary to supply this infor-
     mation in the XF86Config file in most cases.

2.3  IPv6 support

XFree86 4.4 supports IPv6, based on the code contributed by Sun Microsystems
to X.Org. See X.org's document <URL:http://www.x.org/IPV6_Spe-
cific_Changes.html> for a detailled list of the changes.

2.3.1  Protocol names and aliases.

   o tcp is an alias for both IPv6 and IPv4 transports.

   o inet specifies IPv4 only.

   o inet6 specifies IPv6 only.

You can force the X server to only listen to IPv4 connections with the X
-nolisten inet6  command.  Or you can force a IPv6 connection by setting DIS-
PLAY to inet6/host:0.

2.3.2  XDM

The IPv6 XDMCP code is not enabled by default on platforms that don't support
binding a IPv6 socket to a IPv4 address.

The XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 authentification scheme does not support IPv6
addresses. A new release of the protocol, XDM-AUTHORIZATION-2 has been
designed, but is not implemented yet.  Note that  by default XFree86 builds
do not enable the XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 code.

2.4  X Server and Extension Updates

   o The Mesa version used for OpenGL® 1.3 and DRI driver support has been
     updated to 5.0.2.

2.5  Client and Library Updates

2.5.1  Xterm

The user-visible changes to xterm since XFree86 4.3 are:

Bug Fixes:

   o Make signalInhibit resource work, i.e., disable the menu entries that
     would send signals to, or exit xterm.
d94 2
a95 2
   o Make cursor definition in tek4014 emulation work as originally imple-
     mented.
d97 1
a97 2
   o Modify translations for scrollbar so that one can use shifted pageup,
     wheel mouse, etc., while the mouse pointer is over the scrollbar.
d99 3
a101 1
   o Correct initialization of G1 character set mapping.
d103 2
a104 1
New Features:
d106 4
a109 2
   o Modify the predictable version of the generated logfile name to append
     the process-id rather than a random value.
d111 1
a111 2
   o Modify scroll-back and scroll-forw actions to accept an adjustment
     value, e.g.,
d113 3
a115 1
          scroll-back(1, page-2)
d117 1
a117 1
     to scroll back by 2 lines less than a page.
d119 2
a120 2
   o Add visualBellDelay resource to modify the length of time used for
     visual bell, for very slow displays or very fast computers.
d122 1
a122 1
Improved Locale Support:
d124 2
a125 2
   o modify uxterm script to strip modifiers such as "@@euro" from the locale
     setting before adding ".UTF-8".
d127 2
a128 5
   o Add logic to wide-character support which attempts to load fonts speci-
     fied by utf8Fonts subresources at startup.  The subresources have the
     same names as the fonts which they replace, e.g., font, font1, etc., so
     that the ISO-10646-1 fonts can be specified in the XTerm app-defaults
     file.
d130 1
a130 1
   o Improved performance with chinput application.
d132 1
a132 1
Improved Font Handling:
d134 1
a134 2
   o Document in xterm's manpage how to use XFree86 ":unscaled" keyword to
     suppress scaling of bold fonts.
d136 1
a136 1
   o Improved logic for deriving bold fontname from normal fontname.
d138 2
a139 1
   o Make double-width characters work with -u8 option.
d141 2
a142 1
   o Updated table of Unicode line-drawing characters.
d144 2
a145 1
   o Several fixes for rendering using Xft (option -fa):
d147 1
a147 1
        o Make height of TrueType fonts match ascent+descent.
d149 1
a149 4
        o Translate Unicode values (from UTF-8 output to xterm) for line-
          drawing to xterm's internal code, etc., since TrueType fonts gener-
          ally do not have either set of line-drawing glyphs.  xterm can draw
          these directly.
d151 4
a154 2
        o Pass 16-bit values rather than 8-bit values to xtermXftDrawString()
          to allow for wide-characters.
d156 2
a157 1
        o Use built-in line-drawing characters for Xft fonts.
d159 5
a163 1
        o Implement underlining.
d165 3
a167 1
   o Implement boldMode for wide-characters.
d169 4
a172 1
   o Modified to work with CJK double-width (bi-width/monospace) fonts.
d174 1
a174 1
Workarounds for Special Applications:
d176 1
a176 3
   o Add option -k8 and resource allowC1Printable to allow users of non-VTxxx
     character sets such as KOI-8 to treat the C1 control area (character
     codes 128-159) as printable rather than control characters.
d178 1
a178 2
   o Add configure option --enable-broken-st and resource brokenStringTerm to
     allow user to revert one part of the parsing table corrections.
d180 1
a180 5
   o Add configure option --enable-broken-osc and resource brokenLinuxOSC to
     accommodate scripts which do not distinguish between running in the
     Linux console and running in X.  Linux console recognizes malformed con-
     trol strings which start with an OSC, but are fixed-length, with no ter-
     minator.
d182 1
a182 3
   o Add configure option --enable-pty-handshake to allow one to compile-in
     support for the pty handshaking logic, and resource ptyHandshake to
     enable or disable it.  This feature is normally enabled.
d184 1
a184 1
Modified Resources:
d186 2
a187 1
   o Change color4 to "dodger blue", since this provides better contrast.
d189 1
a189 1
   o Remove color resources from XTerm.ad, leaving them only in XTerm-col.ad
d191 1
a191 2
   o Modify UXTerm.ad resource file to include "XTerm-color" rather than
     "XTerm", in case the latter file contains no color resource definitions.
d193 1
a193 2
   o Changed class of veryBoldColors to VeryBoldColors, since ColorMode is
     associated with boolean resources.
d195 1
a195 4
   o Changed classes of colorBDMode and similar resources that override col-
     ors when a video attribute is set to ColorAttrMode, to make them dis-
     tinct from ColorMode.  This avoids an unexpected rendering of reverse
     video, for example.
d197 2
a198 1
Modified terminfo/termcap entries:
d200 1
a200 55
   o Add indp and rin to terminfo entry.

   o Add le to termcap xterm-basic entry.  Though missing from older termcaps
     for xterm, some applications check for it.

   o Correct AF/AB strings in termcap for xterm-256color and xterm-88color
     entries.

2.6  I18N and Font Updates

   o FreeType2 updated to version 2.1.4.

   o The "freetype" X server font backend has been updated by the After X-TT
     Project <URL:http://x-tt.sourceforge.jp/> to include the functionality
     previously provided by the "xtt" backend, and to fix some bugs.  The
     "xtt" backend will be dropped in the next release in favour of the
     updated unified "freetype" backend.

        o The new "freetype" backend has the improved "very lazy" metric cal-
          culation method which enables super-fast loading of proportional
          CJKV fonts.

        o All of the servers, including xfs, Xnest, Xprt, Xvfb, the Cygwin-
          XFree86 server (as well as the XFree86 server) can handle the per-
          fect TTCap options.

   o The Compose file processing mechanism has been improved and made more
     flexible.  See the Xlib Compose  file support and extensions section
     below (section 4.20, page 1).

2.7  OS Support Updates

   o On Mac OS X, the appropriate backend drawing code is now dynamically
     loaded at runtime. This reduces the X server's memory footprint.  In
     rootless mode, Apple's Xplugin library is used where available.  (Xplu-
     gin is included as part of Mac OS X on Panther.) With Xplugin, XDarwin
     provides identical performance to Apple's X11, including the following
     improvements over 4.3:

        o Added direct GLX rendering with thread support.

        o Faster 2-D drawing.

        o Added support for the Apple-WM extension so XDarwin interoperates
          with quartz-wm.

   o On Darwin, IOKit mode now uses shadowfb for much faster drawing.

   o Various GNU/Hurd support updates.

   o Experimental support added for GNU/KFreeBSD and GNU/KNetBSD systems.

   o SCO OpenServer support updates.  XFree86 4.4 now works on Release 5.0.7
     with Maintenance Pack 1, or on prior releases through Release 5.0.4.
     Please consult the README.SCO file for details.

XFree86 4.x has a single X server binary called XFree86.  This binary can
either have one or more video and input drivers linked in statically, or,
more usually, dynamically load the video drivers, input drivers, and other
d308 5
a312 5
XFree86 4.3.99.903 has X server support for most UNIX® and UNIX-like operat-
ing systems on Intel/x86 platforms, plus support for Linux and some BSD OSs
on Alpha, PowerPC, IA-64, AMD64, Sparc, and Mips platforms, and for Darwin on
PowerPC.  Work on support for additional architectures and operating systems
is in progress, and is planned for future releases.
d316 8
a323 9
The XFree86 X server has a built-in run-time loader developed from code
donated by Metro Link <URL:http://www.metrolink.com>.  This loader can load
normal object files and libraries in most of the commonly used formats.
Since the loader doesn't rely on an operating system's native dynamic loader
support, it works on platforms that don't provide this feature, and makes it
possible for the modules to be operating system independent (although not, of
course, independent of CPU architecture).  This means that a module compiled
on Linux/x86 can be loaded by an X server running on Solaris/x86, or FreeBSD,
or even OS/2.

a328 1
they do not need to be recompiled for every different operating system.
d330 2
a331 2
The loader in version 4.3.99.903 has support for Intel (x86), Alpha and Pow-
erPC platforms.  It also has preliminary support for Sparc platforms.
d337 4
a340 6
The module interfaces (API and ABI) used in this release is subject to change
without notice.  While we will attempt to provide backward compatibility for
the module interfaces as of the 4.0 release (meaning that 4.0 modules will
work with future core X server binaries), we cannot guarantee this.  Compati-
bility in the other direction is explicitly not guaranteed because new mod-
ules may rely on interfaces added in new releases.
d354 163
a516 7
The XFree86 server uses a configuration file as the primary mechanism for
providing configuration and run-time parameters.  The configuration file for-
mat is described in detail in the XF86Config(5) manual page.

The XFree86 server has support for automatically determining an initial con-
figuration on most platforms, as well as support or generating a basic ini-
tial configuration file.
d520 111

Command line options can be used to override some default parameters and
parameters provided in the configuration file.  These command line options
are described in the XFree86(1) manual page.

DGA 2.0 is included in 4.3.99.903.  Documentation for the client libraries
can be found in the XDGA(3) man page.  A good degree of backwards compatibil-
ity with version 1.0 is provided.

Direct rendered OpenGL® support is provided for several hardware platforms by
the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI).  Further information about DRI can
be found at the DRI Project's web site <URL:http://dri.sf.net/>.  The 3D core
rendering component is provided by Mesa <URL:http://www.mesa3d.org>.

Only three applications have been modified in XFree86 4.3.99.903 to work with
the Render extension and the Xft and FreeType libraries to provide anti-
aliased text.  Xterm, xditview and x11perf.  Migration of other applications
may occur in future releases.

a838 6
XFree86 4.x comes with two TrueType backends, known as "FreeType" backend
(the "freetype" module) and `X-TrueType' (the "xtt" module).  Both of these
backends are based on the FreeType library.  The functionality of X-TrueType
has been merged into the FreeType backend by the After X-TT Project for
XFree86 4.4.  Consequently, the old X-TrueType backend will be dropped as of
XFree86 4.5.
d897 1
a897 49
4.20  Xlib Compose file support and extensions

A more flexible Compose file processing system was added to Xlib in XFree86
4.4.0.  The compose file is searched for in the following order:

  1.  If the environment variable $XCOMPOSEFILE is set, its value is used as
      the name of the Compose file.

  2.  If the user's home direcotry has a file named ".XCompose", it is used
      as the Compose file.

  3.  The old method is used, and the compose file is "<xlocaledir>/<locale-
      name>/Compose".

Compose files can now use an "include" instruction.  This allows local modi-
fications to be made to existing compose files without including all of the
content directly.  For example, the system's iso8859-1 compose file can be
included with a line like this:

     include "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/iso8859-1/Compose"

There are two substitutions that can be made in the file name of the include
instruction.  %H expands to the user's home directory (the $HOME environment
variable), and %L expands to the name of the locale specific Compose file
(i.e., "<xlocaledir>/<localename>/Compose").

For example, you can include in your compose file the default Compose file by
using:

     include "%L"

and then rewrite only the few rules that you need to change.  New compose
rules can be added, and previous ones replaced.

Finally, it is no longer necessary to specify in the right part of a rule a
locale encoded string in addition to the keysym name.  If the string is
opmitted, Xlib figures it out from the keysym according to the current
locale.  I.e., if a rule looks like:

     <dead_grave> <A> : "\300" Agrave

the result of the composition is always the letter with the "\300" code.  But
if the rule is:

     <dead_grave> <A> : Agrave

the result depends on how Agrave is mapped in the current locale.

@                   Information for Number Nine I128 Users

                          The XFree86 Project Inc.

                               3 November 2000

1.  Supported hardware

The current accelerated I128 server supports

   o Imagine 128 (I128 with Texas Instruments TVP3025 or IBM528 RAMDAC). It
     has been tested with with 4MB of VRAM.

   o Imagine 128 Ticket 2 Ride (I128-T2R with IBM526 or 528 RAMDAC). It has
     been tested with 4 MB and 8 MB of VRAM and DRAM.

   o Imagine 128 Revolution 3D (I128-R3D with IBM526 RAMDAC).  It has been
     tested with 4 MB, 8 MB, and 16 MB of WRAM or SGRAM.

   o Imagine 128 Revolution IV (I128-R4 with SILVERHAMMER RAMDAC).  It has
     been tested with 32 MB.

2.  Features:

   o uses linear frame buffer

   o Resolutions up to the maximum supported by the card should be possible.

   o 8 bpp, 16 bpp (depth 15 and 16), and 32 bpp (depth 24, sparse) are sup-
     ported.

   o supports RGB Sync-on-Green

   o Makes use of the graphics accelerator.

3.  Configuration:

The I128 driver should auto-detect all supported hardware so you needn't have
anything other than the Identifier in the Section "Device" of the XF86Config
file.  When running the XF86Setup or xf86config programs one merely needs to
select an I128 card so that the correct server will be used.  One need not
and should not specify a RAMDAC, clockchip or allow the setup program to
probe for clocks. The driver will auto-detect the amount of video ram pre-
sent.

The following Section "Device" options are supported by the I128 driver:

   o Option "Dac6Bit"

     Will enable 6-bit DAC support.

   o Option "NoAccel"

     Will disable all hardware acceleration.

   o Option "SyncOnGreen"

     Will enable syncing on green for sync-on-green monitors (these are typi-
     cally fixed frequency workstation monitors).

4.  Mode lines for the Silicon Graphics flat panel display:

   o These mode lines are required for use with the T2R4 (Rev 4) and the Sil-
     icon Graphics Flat Panel display.

   o Modeline "1600x1024d32" 103.125  1600 1600 1656 1664 1024 1024 1029 1030
     HSkew 7 +Hsync +Vsync

   o Modeline "1600x1024d16" 103.125  1600 1600 1656 1664 1024 1024 1029 1030
     HSkew 5 +Hsync +Vsync

   o Modeline "1600x1024d08" 103.125  1600 1600 1656 1664 1024 1024 1029 1030
     HSkew 1 +Hsync +Vsync

   o Modeline "800x512d32"   54.375   800 800 840 848 512 512 514 515 HSkew 7
     DoubleScan +Hsync +Vsync

   o Modeline "800x512d16"   54.375   800 800 840 848 512 512 514 515 HSkew 5
     DoubleScan +Hsync +Vsync

   o Modeline "800x512d08"   54.375   800 800 840 848 512 512 514 515 HSkew 1
     DoubleScan +Hsync +Vsync

   o These lines are required for use with the SGI Multilink Adapter and the
     SiliconGraphics Flat Panel display.

   o Modeline "1600x1024g" 108.0  1600 1616 1656 1704 1024 1027 1030 1056

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

    <sect>Introduction <p>

        This document describes how to download, compile and install the
        DRI project.
        The DRI provides 3D graphics hardware acceleration for the XFree86
        project.
        This information is intended for experienced Linux developers.
        Beginners are probably better off installing precompiled packages.

        to <email>brian@@tungstengrahpics.com</email>.


    <sect>Prerequisites <p>

        You'll need the following:
        <itemize>
          <item>At least 200MB of free disk space.
            If you compile for debugging (the -g option) then you'll need
            about 600MB.
          <item>GCC compiler and related tools.
          <item>ssh (secure shell) for registered developer downloading of the
            DRI source tree
          <item>A recent Linux Kernel.  See below for details.
          <item>FreeBSD support is not currently being maintained and may not
            work.
        </itemize>

      <p>
        The DRI 3D drivers generally work on systems with Intel or AMD CPUs.
        However, there is limited support for Alpha and PowerPC support is
        underway.

      <p>
        For 3dfx Voodoo3 hardware, you'll also need:
        <itemize>
          <item>Glide3 headers and runtime library if you want to use the
            3dfx driver.
            These can be obtained from
            <htmlurl url="http://linux.3dfx.com/open_source/glide_kit.htm"
            name="linux.3dfx.com">.
          <item>A recent Linux 2.4.x kernel.  AGP support is not required.
        </itemize>

      <p>
        For Matrox G200/G400 hardware, you'll also need:
        <itemize>
          <item>A recent Linux 2.4.x kernel with AGP support.
        </itemize>

      <p>
        For Intel i810 hardware, you'll also need:
        <itemize>
          <item>A recent Linux 2.4.x kernel with AGP support.
        </itemize>

      <p>
        For ATI Rage 128 and Radeon hardware, you'll also need:
        <itemize>
          <item>A recent Linux 2.4.x kernel with AGP support.
        </itemize>


    <sect>Linux Kernel Preparation <p>

        The DRI project closely tracks Linux kernel development.  Since
        the internal Linux data structures might change in the 2.4 Linux
        kernel, it's important to use the most recent Linux kernel and
        not an old, intermediate development release.
        As of this writing (Jan 2001), 2.4.0 is the most recent version
        of Linux which the DRI is synchronized to.
      <p>
        Most of the DRI drivers require AGP support and using Intel
        Pentium III SSE optimizations also requires an up-to-date Linux
	kernel.  Configuring your kernel correctly is very important, as
        features such as SSE optimizations will be disabled if your
        kernel does not support them.  Thus, if you have a Pentium III
        processor, you must configure your kernel for the Pentium III
        processor family.
      <p>
        Building a new Linux kernel can be difficult for beginners but
        there are resources on the Internet to help.
        This document assumes experience with configuring, building and
        installing Linux kernels.
      <p>
        Linux kernels can be downloaded from
        <htmlurl url="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/"
        name="www.kernel.org">
      <p>
        Here are the basic steps for kernel setup.
        <itemize>
        <item>Download the needed kernel and put it in /usr/src.
          Create a directory for the source and unpack it.
          For example:
          <verb>
          cd /usr/src
          rm -f linux
          mkdir linux-2.4.x
          ln -s linux-2.4.x linux
          bzcat linux-2.4.x.tar.bz2 | tar xf -
          </verb>
	  It is critical that /usr/src/linux point to your new kernel
          sources, otherwise the kernel headers <bf>will not</bf> be
          used when building the DRI.  This will almost certainly cause
          compilation problems.
	<item>Read /usr/src/linux/Documentation/Changes.
	  This file lists the minimum requirements for all software
	  packages required to build the kernel.  You must upgrade at
	  least gcc, make, binutils and modutils to at least the
	  versions specified in this file.  The other packages may not
	  be needed.  If you are upgrading from Linux 2.2.x you must
	  upgrade your modutils package for Linux 2.4.x.
	<item>Configure your kernel.
          You might, for example, use <tt>make menuconfig</tt> and do the
          following:

          <itemize>
	  <item>Go to <em>Code maturity level options</em>
	  <item>Enable <em>Prompt for development and/or incomplete
	    code/drivers</em>
	  <item>hit ESC to return to the top-level menu
	  <item>Go to <em>Processor type and features</em>
	  <item>Select your processor type from <em>Processor Family</em>
	  <item>hit ESC to return to the top-level menu
          <item>Go to <em>Character devices</em>
          <item>Disable <em>Direct Rendering Manager (XFree86 DRI support)</em>
            since we'll use the DRI code from the XFree86/DRI tree and will
            compile it there.
          <item>Go to <em>/dev/agpgart (AGP Support) (EXPERIMENTAL) (NEW)</em>
	  <item>Hit SPACE twice to build AGP support into the kernel
          <item>Enable all chipsets' support for AGP
          <item>It's recommended that you turn on MTRRs under
            <em>Processor type and Features</em>, but not required.
          </itemize>
        <item>Configure the rest of the kernel as required for your system
          (i.e. Ethernet, SCSI, etc)
        <item>Exit, saving your kernel configuration.
        <item>Edit your /etc/lilo.conf file.
          Make sure you have an image entry as follows (or similar):
            <verb>
            image=/boot/vmlinuz
                  label=linux.2.4.x
                  read-only
                  root=/dev/hda1
            </verb>
	  The important part is that you have /boot/vmlinuz without a
	  trailing version number.
	  If this is the first entry in your /etc/lilo.conf AND you
	  haven't set a default, then this will be your default kernel.
        <item>Compile the new kernel.
          <verb>
          cd /usr/src/linux-2.4.x
          make dep
          make bzImage
          make modules
          make modules_install
          make install
          </verb>
          Note that last make command will automatically run lilo for you.
        <item>Now reboot to use the new kernel.
        </itemize>


    <sect>CPU Architectures <p>

        In general, nothing special has to be done to use the DRI on
        different CPU architectures.  There are, however, a few
        optimizations that are CPU-dependent.  Mesa will determine at
        runtime which CPU-dependent optimizations should be used and
	enable them where appropriate.

        <sect1>Intel Pentium III Features <p>

            The Pentium III SSE (Katmai) instructions are used in
            optimized vertex transformation functions in the Mesa-based
            DRI drivers.
            On Linux, SSE requires a recent kernel (such as 2.4.0-test11
            or later) both at compile time and runtime.

        <sect1>AMD 3DNow! Features <p>

            AMD's 3DNow! instructions are used in optimized vertex
            transformation functions in the Mesa-based DRI drivers.
            3DNow! is supported in most versions of Linux.

        <sect1>Alpha Features <p>

            On newer Alpha processors a significant performance increase
            can be seen with the addition of the -mcpu= option to GCC.
            This option is dependent on the architecture of the processor.
            For example, -mcpu=ev6 will build specifically for the EV6 based
            AXP's, giving both byte and word alignment access to the
            DRI/Mesa drivers.

            To enable this optimization edit your xc/config/host.def file
            and add the line:

            #define DefaultGcc2AxpOpt -O2 -mcpu=ev6 

            Additional speed improvements to 3D rendering can be achieved
            by installing Compaq's Math Libraries (CPML) which can be 
            obtained from 
            <htmlurl url="http://www.support.compaq.com/alpha-tools/software/index.html"
            name="http://www.support.compaq.com/alpha-tools/software/index.html">

            Once installed, you can add this line to your host.def to build
            with the CPML libraries:

            #define UseCompaqMathLibrary YES

            The host.def file is explained below.



    <sect>Downloading the XFree86/DRI CVS Sources <p>

        The DRI project is hosted by VA Linux Systems'
        <htmlurl url="http://dri.sourceforge.net/"
        name="SourceForge">.
        The DRI source code, which is a subset of the XFree86 source tree,
        is kept in a CVS repository there.
      <p>
        The DRI CVS sources may be accessed either anonymously or as a
        registered SourceForge user.
        It's recommended that you become a registered SourceForge user so
        that you may submit non-anonymous bug reports and can participate
        in the mailing lists.

      <sect1>Anonymous CVS download: <p>

        <enum>
          <item>Create a directory to store the CVS files:
            <p>
            <verb>
            cd ~
            mkdir DRI-CVS
            </verb>
            You could put your CVS directory in a different place but we'll
            use <tt>~/DRI-CVS/</tt> here.
            <p>
          <item>Check out the CVS sources:
            <p>
            <verb>
            cd ~/DRI-CVS
            cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@@cvs.dri.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/dri login
              (hit ENTER when prompted for a password)
            cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@@cvs.dri.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/dri co xc
            </verb>
            <p>
            The -z3 flag causes compression to be used in order to reduce
            the download time.
        </enum>


      <sect1>Registered CVS download: <p>

        <enum>
          <item>Create a directory to store the CVS files:
            <p>
            <verb>
            cd ~
            mkdir DRI-CVS
            </verb>
            You could put your CVS directory in a different place but we'll
            use <tt>~/DRI-CVS/</tt> here.
            <p>
          <item>Set the CVS_RSH environment variable:
            <p>
            <verb>
            setenv CVS_RSH ssh      // if using csh or tcsh
            export CVS_RSH=ssh      // if using sh or bash
            </verb>
          <item>Check out the CVS sources:
            <p>
            <verb>
            cd ~/DRI-CVS
            cvs -z3 -d:ext:YOURID@@cvs.dri.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/dri co xc
            </verb>
            Replace <tt>YOURID</tt> with your CVS login name.
            You'll be prompted to enter your sourceforge password.
            <p>
            The -z3 flag causes compression to be used in order to reduce
            the download time.
        </enum>


      <sect1>Updating your CVS sources <p>

	  In the future you'll want to occasionally update your local copy of
	  the DRI source code to get the latest changes.
	  This can be done with:
	  <verb>
	      cd ~/DRI-CVS
	      cvs -z3 update -dA xc
	  </verb>
	  The -d flag causes any new subdirectories to be created and -A causes
	  most recent trunk sources to be fetched, not branch sources.


    <sect>Mesa <p>

        Most of the DRI 3D drivers are based on Mesa (the free implementation
        of the OpenGL API).
        The relevant files from Mesa are already included in the XFree86/DRI
        source tree.
        <em>There is no need to download or install the Mesa source files
        separately.</em>
      <p>
        Sometimes a newer version of Mesa will be available than the version
        included in XFree86/DRI.
        Upgrading Mesa within XFree86/DRI is not always straightforward.
        It can be an error-prone undertaking, especially for beginners, and is
        not generally recommended.
        The DRI developers will upgrade Mesa when appropriate.
      <p>


    <sect>Compiling the XFree86/DRI tree <p>
      <sect1>Make a build tree <p>

          Rather than placing object files and library files right in the
          source tree, they're instead put into a parallel <em>build</em> tree.
          The build tree is made with the <tt>lndir</tt> command:
          <verb>
            cd ~/DRI-CVS
            ln -s xc XFree40
            mkdir build
            cd build
            lndir -silent -ignorelinks ../XFree40
          </verb>
        <p>
          The build tree will be populated with symbolic links which point
          back into the CVS source tree.
        <p>
          Advanced users may have several build trees for compiling and
          testing with different options.

      <sect1>Edit the host.def file <p>
        <p>
          The <tt>~/DRI-CVS/build/xc/config/cf/host.def</tt> file is used
          to configure the XFree86 build process.
          You can change it to customize your build options or make adjustments
          for your particular system configuration
        <p>
          The default <tt>host.def</tt> file will look something like this:
          <verb>
            #define DefaultCCOptions -Wall
(i386)      #define DefaultGcc2i386Opt -O2
(Alpha)     #define DefaultGcc2AxpOpt -O2 -mcpu=ev6 (or similar)
            #define LibraryCDebugFlags -O2
            #define BuildServersOnly YES
            #define XF86CardDrivers vga tdfx mga ati i810
            #define LinuxDistribution LinuxRedHat
            #define DefaultCCOptions -ansi GccWarningOptions -pipe
            #define BuildXF86DRI YES
            #define HasGlide3 YES  
            /* Optionally turn these on for debugging */
            /* #define GlxBuiltInTdfx YES */
            /* #define GlxBuiltInMga YES */
            /* #define GlxBuiltInR128 YES */
            /* #define GlxBuiltInRadeon YES */
            /* #define DoLoadableServer NO */
            #define SharedLibFont NO
          </verb>
          The <tt>ProjectRoot</tt> variable specifies where the XFree86 files
          will be installed.
          You probably don't want to use <tt>/usr/X11R6/</tt> because that
          would overwrite your default X files.
          The following is recommended:
          <verb>
            #define ProjectRoot /usr/X11R6-DRI
          </verb>
        <p>
          Especially note the <em>XF86CardDrivers</em> line to be sure your
          driver is listed.
        <p>
          If you have 3dfx hardware be sure that the Glide 3x headers are
          installed in <tt>/usr/include/glide3/</tt> and that the Glide 3x
          library is installed at <tt>/usr/lib/libglide3.so</tt>.
        <p>
          If you do not have 3dfx hardware comment out the <tt>HasGlide3</tt>
          line in <tt>host.def</tt>.
        <p>
	  If you want to enable 3DNow! optimizations in Mesa and the DRI
	  drivers, you should add the following: 
          <verb>
            #define MesaUse3DNow YES
          </verb>
        <p>
	  If you want to enable SSE optimizations in Mesa and the DRI
	  drivers, you <bf>must</bf> upgrade to a Linux 2.4.x kernel.
	  Mesa will verify that SSE is supported by both your processor
	  <em>and</em> your operating system, but to build Mesa inside
	  the DRI you need to have the Linux 2.4.x kernel headers in
	  /usr/src/linux.  If you enable SSE optimizations with an
	  earlier version of the Linux kernel in /usr/src/linux, Mesa
	  <bf>will not compile</bf>.  You have been warned.  If you do
	  have a 2.4.x kernel, you should add the following: 
          <verb>
            #define MesaUseKatmai YES
          </verb>
	<p>

      <sect1>Compilation <p>

          To compile the complete DRI tree:
          <verb>
            cd ~/DRI-CVS/build/xc/
            make World >& World.LOG
          </verb>
          Or if you want to watch the compilation progress:
          <verb>
            cd ~/DRI-CVS/build/xc/
            make World >& World.LOG &
            tail -f World.LOG
          </verb>
          With the default compilation flags it's normal to get a lot of
          warnings during compilation.
        <p>
          Building will take some time so you may want to go check your
          email or visit slashdot.
        <p>
	  <em>WARNING:</em> do not use the -j option with make.
          It's reported that it does not work with XFree86/DRI.
        <p>

      <sect1>Check for compilation errors <p>

          Using your text editor, examine <tt>World.LOG</tt> for errors
          by searching for the pattern <tt>***</tt>.
        <p>
          Verify that the DRI kernel module(s) for your system were built:
          <verb>
          cd ~/DRI-CVS/build/xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/os-support/linux/drm/kernel
          ls
          </verb>
        <p>
          For the 3dfx Voodoo, you should see <em>tdfx.o</em>.
          For the Matrox G200/G400, you should see <em>mga.o</em>.
          For the ATI Rage 128, you should see <em>r128.o</em>.
          For the ATI Radeon, you should see <em>radeon.o</em>.
          For the Intel i810, you should see <em>i810.o</em>.
        <p>
          If the DRI kernel module(s) failed to build you should verify
          that you're using the right version of the Linux kernel.
          The most recent kernels are not always supported.
        <p>
          If your build machine is running a different version of the kernel
          than your target machine (i.e. 2.2.x vs. 2.4.x), make will
          select the wrong kernel headers. This can be fixed by explicitly
          setting the value of <tt>TREE</tt>.
          If the path to your kernel source is 
          <tt>/usr/src/linux-2.4.x</tt>,
          <verb>
          cd ~/DRI-CVS/build/xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/os-support/linux/drm/kernel
          make TREE=/usr/src/linux-2.4.x/include
          </verb>
          or alternatively, edit Makefile to include this change.
        <p>
          After fixing the errors, run <tt>make World</tt> again.
          Later, you might just compile parts of the source tree but it's
          important that the whole tree will build first.

      <sect1>DRI kernel module installation <p>

        The DRI kernel modules are in
        <tt>~/DRI-CVS/build/xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/os-support/linux/drm/kernel/</tt>.
        <p>
        To load the appropriate DRM module in your running kernel you can
        either use ismod and restart your X server or copy the kernel module
        to <tt>/lib/modules/2.4.x/kernel/drivers/char/drm/</tt> then run
        depmod and restart your X server.
        <p>
        Make sure you first unload any older DRI kernel modules that might
        be already loaded.
        <p>
        Note that some DRM modules require that the <tt>agpgart</tt> module
        be loaded first.
        <p>

    <sect>Normal Installation and Configuration <p>

        Most users will want to install the new X server and use it instead
        of the original X server.
        This section explains how to do that.
        We assume that the user is upgrading from XFree86 3.3.x.
        <p>
        Developers, on the other hand, may just want to test the X server
        without actually installing it as their default server.
        If you want to do that, skip to the next section.
        <p>

      <sect1>X Installation <p>

          You'll need to run as root to do the following commands:
          <verb>
	      su
          </verb>
	  As mentioned above, the installation directory is specified by the
	  <tt>ProjectRoot</tt> variable in the <tt>host.def</tt> file.
	  Create that directory now if it doesn't already exist, then
          run the install commands:
	  <verb>
	      mkdir /usr/X11R6-DRI
	      cd ~/DRI-CVS/build/xc
	      make install
	  </verb>

      <sect1>Linker configuration <p>

	  Edit your <tt>/etc/ld.so.conf</tt> file and put
	  <tt>/usr/X11R6-DRI/lib</tt> as the first line.
	  Then run:
	  <verb>
	      ldconfig
	  </verb>
          This will ensure that you use the new X libraries when you run
          X programs.
        <p>

      <sect1>Update Locale Information <p>

          To update your X locale information do the following:
          <verb>
             cd ~/DRI-CVS/build/xc/nls
             ../config/util/xmkmf -a
             make
             make install
          </verb>
          This will prevent a locale error message from being printed
          when you run Xlib programs.

      <sect1>Setup Miscellaneous Files <p>

          Issue the following commands:
          <verb>
             cd /usr/X11R6-DRI/lib/X11
             ln -s /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/rgb.txt .
             ln -s /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts .
             ln -s /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults .
          </verb>

          This will allow applications to use the fonts and resources
          that they used in the past.

      <sect1>Disable the Old X Server and Enable the New One <p>

          Assuming that an installation of XFree86 3.3.x is present, we need
          to disable the old 3.3.x X server and enable the new 4.0.x X server.
        <p>
          Issue the following commands:
          <verb>
             cd /usr/X11R6/bin
             mv Xwrapper Xwrapper.old
             rm X
             ln -s /usr/X11R6-DRI/bin/XFree86  X
          </verb>
          This will cause the new X server to be used instead of the
          original one.
        <p>

      <sect1>Create the XF86Config File <p>

          Configuration files for XFree86 3.3.x will not work with
          XFree86 4.0.x.
        <p>
          The new 4.0.x server can generate a basic configuration file
          itself.
          Simply do this:
          <verb>
             cd /usr/X11R6-DRI/bin
             ./XFree86 -configure
          </verb>
          A file named <tt>/root/XF86Config.new</tt> will be created.
          It should allow you to try your X server but you'll almost
          certainly have to edit it.
          For example, you should add <tt>HorizSync</tt> and
          <tt>VertRefresh</tt> options to the <tt>Monitor</tt> section
          and <tt>Modes</tt> options to the <tt>Screen</tt> section.
          Also, the <tt>ModulePath</tt> option in the <tt>Files</tt>
          section should be set to <tt>/usr/X11R6-DRI/lib/modules</tt>.
        <p>
          On the DRI web site, in the resources section, you'll find example
          XF86Config files for a number of graphics cards.
          These configuration files also setup DRI options so it's highly
          recommended that you look at these examples.
        <p>
          In any case, your new XF86Config file should be placed in
          <tt>/etc/X11/XF86Config-4</tt>.
          This configuration file will be recognized by the 4.0.x server
          but not by 3.3.x servers.
          You can instead name it <tt>/etc/X11/XF86Config</tt> but
          that'll overwrite your old config file, which you may want to
          preserve.
        <p>

      <sect1>Start the New X Server <p>

          The new X server should be ready to use now.
          Start your X server in your usual manner.
          Typically, the <tt>startx</tt> command is used:
          <verb>
             startx
          </verb>


    <sect>Testing the Server Without Installing It <p>

        As mentioned at the start of section 8, developers may want to
        simply run the X server without installing it.
        This can save some time and allow you to keep a number of X servers
        available for testing.
      <p>

      <sect1>Configuration <p>
        As described in the preceding section, you'll need to create a
        configuration file for the new server.
        Put the <tt>XF86Config</tt> file in your
        <tt>~/DRI-CVS/build/xc/programs/Xserver</tt> directory.
      <p>
        Be sure the <tt>ModulePath</tt> option is set correctly.
      <p>

      <sect1>A Startup Script <p>
        A simple shell script can be used to start the X server.
        Here's an example.
        <verb>
	   #!/bin/sh
	   export DISPLAY=:0
	   ./XFree86 -xf86config XF86Config & \
	   sleep 2
	   fvwm2 &
	   xset b off
	   xmodmap -e "clear mod4"
	   xsetroot -solid "#00306f"
	   xterm -geometry 80x40+0+0
        </verb>
	  You might name this script <tt>start-dri</tt>.
	  Put it in your <tt>~/DRI-CVS/build/xc/programs/Xserver</tt>
          directory.
        <p>
          To test the server run the script:
          <verb>
             cd ~/DRI-CVS/build/xc/programs/Xserver
             ./start-dri
          </verb>
          For debugging, you may also want to capture the log messages
          printed by the server in a file.
          If you're using the C-shell:
          <verb>
             ./start-dri >& log
          </verb>


    <sect>Where To Go From Here <p>

        At this point your X server should be up and running with
        hardware-accelerated direct rendering.
        Please read the
        <htmlurl url="http://dri.sourceforge.net/doc/DRIuserguide.html"
        name="DRI User Guide"> for information about trouble shooting
        and how to use the DRI-enabled X server for 3D applications.

log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

	  <item>An installation of XFree86 4.1 or later.
            The DRI tree has been pruned down to minimize its size.
            But in order to build the DRI tree you need to have recent X
            header files, etc. already installed.
            If you don't have XFree86 4.1 (or later) installed you can
            probably install it from RPMs (or another package format).
            Or, you can download XFree86 as sources and compile/install
            it yourself.

        For 3dfx Voodoo hardware, you'll also need the Glide3 runtime

        Voodoo4/5).
        These can be downloaded from the DRI website.

        For Matrox G200/G400, Intel i810/i830 or ATI Rage128/Radeon hardware,

        or as a loadable module.

          We recommend installing the DRI files over your existing XFree86
          installation - it's generally safe to do and less error-prone.
          This policy is different than what we used to recommend.
        <p>
          If XFree86 4.x is not installed in /usr/X11R6/ you'll have to
          add the following to the <tt>host.def</tt> file:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

	  <item>An installation of XFree86 4.1 or later.
            The DRI tree has been pruned down to minimize its size.
            But in order to build the DRI tree you need to have recent X
            header files, etc. already installed.
            If you don't have XFree86 4.1 (or later) installed you can
            probably install it from RPMs (or another package format).
            Or, you can download XFree86 as sources and compile/install
            it yourself.

        For 3dfx Voodoo hardware, you'll also need the Glide3 runtime
        library (libglide3-v3.so for Voodoo3 or libglide3-v5.so for
        Voodoo4/5).
        These can be downloaded from the DRI website.
        You can compile them yourself, but it's often a painful process.

        For Matrox G200/G400, Intel i810/i830 or ATI Rage128/Radeon hardware,
        you'll also need AGP support in your Linux kernel, either built-in
        or as a loadable module.

        Only the Linux 2.4.x kernels are currently supported by the DRI
        hardware drivers.  2.5.x kernels may work, but aren't tested.

          We recommend installing the DRI files over your existing XFree86
          installation - it's generally safe to do and less error-prone.
          This policy is different than what we used to recommend.
        <p>
          If XFree86 4.x is not installed in /usr/X11R6/ you'll have to
          add the following to the <tt>host.def</tt> file:

            #define ProjectRoot pathToYourXFree86installation

          You don't have to be using an AMD processor in order to enable
          this option.  The DRI will look for 3DNow! support and runtime
          and only enable it if applicable.

          You may need to edit your XF86Config file to enable the DRI.
          The config file is usually installed as
          <tt>/etc/X11/XF86Config-4</tt>.
          See the DRI User Guide for details, but basically, you need
          to load the "glx" and "dri" modules and add a "DRI" section.

a616 4
          On the DRI web site, in the resources section, you'll find example
          XF86Config files for a number of graphics cards.
          These configuration files also setup DRI options so it's highly
          recommended that you look at these examples.

	<p>
	  If you want to build the DRM kernel modules as part of the
	  full build process, add the following:
          <verb>
            #define BuildXF86DRM YES
          </verb>
	  Otherwise, you'll need to build them separately as described below.
a465 6

        <p>
          After fixing the errors, run <tt>make World</tt> again.
          Later, you might just compile parts of the source tree but it's
          important that the whole tree will build first.

d467 1
a467 2
          If you edited your host.def file to enable automatic building of the
          DRI kernel module(s), verify that they were built:
a471 6
	  Otherwise, build them now by running
          <verb>
          cd ~/DRI-CVS/build/xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/os-support/linux/drm/kernel
          make -f Makefile.linux
          </verb>

          select the wrong kernel source tree. This can be fixed by explicitly
          setting the value of <tt>LINUXDIR</tt>.
d491 1
a491 1
          make -f Makefile.linux LINUXDIR=/usr/src/linux-2.4.x
d493 5
a497 2
	  or alternatively, edit Makefile.linux to set <tt>LINUXDIR</tt>
	  before the <tt>ifndef LINUXDIR</tt> line.

<sect> Introduction <p>

This driver is written by Thomas Winischhofer and is a (nearly) complete re-write
of a driver written for the SiS6326 and SiS530 by Alan Hourihane and others.

It currently supports the following chipsets:
<itemize>
   <item>old series: 5597/5598, 6236/AGP/DVD, 530/620
   <item>300 series: 300/305, 540, 630/730
   <item>315 series: 315, 550, 650, 651, M650, 740
   <item>330 series: 330 ("Xabre"), 661FX, M661FX, 741, 760
</itemize>

The driver supports:
<itemize>
  <item>8/16/24 bits color depth; old series also 15;
  <item>XAA (XFree86 Acceleration Architecture)
  <item>XVideo (Xv)
  <item>Render (XRAND)
  <item>Hardware cursor; 315/330 series: Color HW cursor;
  <item>6326: TV output
  <item>300/315/330 series: TV output via Chrontel TV encoders or SiS video bridges
  <item>300/315/330 series: LCD output via LVDS transmitters or SiS video bridges
  <item>300/315/330 series: Dual head mode; Xinerama; Merged framebuffer mode;
</itemize>

This document gives an overview over the driver's features and configuration options.
Please see http://www.winischhofer.net/linuxsisvga.shtml for detailed documentation
and updates. Support for the 661, 741 and 760 is entirely untested as of this writing,
and possibly incomplete for LCD output.

<sect> XF86Config Options <p>

The following options are of particular interest for the SiS
driver. Each of them must be specified in the Device section of the
XF86Config file for this card.

<sect1>For all chipsets<p>

<descrip>
<tag>Option "SWCursor", "HWCursor"</tag>
	These options select whether the software (SW) or hardware (HW) cursor should
	be used. The default is using the hardware cursor.
<tag>Option "NoAccel"</tag>
        Disables 2D acceleration. Default: 2D acceleration is enabled.
<tag>Option "Turboqueue"</tag>
	SiS chipsets have the option to extend the engine command queue on
	VRAM. This concept is called "TurboQueue" and gives some performance improvement.
	Due to hardware bugs, the TurboQueue is disabled on the 530/620, otherwise
	enabled by default.
<tag>Option "Rotate"</tag>
        This option enables clockwise ("CW") or counter-clockwise ("CCW") rotation of
	the display. Enabling either CW or CCW rotation disables the RandR extension.
	Default: no rotation.
<tag>Option "ShadowFB"</tag>
        This option enables the shadow framebuffer layer. By default, it is disabled.
<tag>Option "NoXVideo"</tag>
        Disables the XVideo support. Default: XVideo support is enabled.
<tag>Option "CRT1Gamma"</tag>
        Enables or disables gamma correction. Default: gamma correction is enabled.
</descrip>

<sect1>old series specific options <p>

<descrip>
<tag>Option "FastVram"</tag>
        Enables 1 cycle memory access for read and write operations. The default
	depends on the chipset used.
<tag>Option "NoHostBus"</tag>
        For 5597/5598 only. This option, if set, disables the CPU to VGA host bus.
	Disabling the host bus will result in a severe performance regression.
<tag>VideoRAM size</tag> The SiS 6326 can only directly address 4096K
        bytes of video RAM. However, there are some cards out there featuring
	8192K (8MB) of video RAM. This RAM is not addressable by the engines.
	Therefore, by default, the driver will only use 4096K. This behavior
	can be overridden by specifying the amount of video RAM using the
	VideoRAM keyword. If more than 4096K is specified, the driver will
	disable 2D acceleration, Xv and the HW cursor. On all other chipsets,
	this keyword is ignored.
<tag>Option "NoYV12"</tag>
        Due to hardware bugs, XVideo may display a corrupt image when using
	YV12 encoded material. This option, if set, disables support for YV12
	and hence forces the Xv-aware application to use either YUV2 or XShm
	for video output.
<tag>Option "TVStandard"</tag>
	(6326 only) Selects the TV output standard. May be PAL or NTSC. By default,
	this is selected by a jumper on the card.
</descrip>

<sect1>300/315/330 series specific options<p>

<descrip>
<tag>Option "ForceCRT1"</tag>
        Enables or disables CRT1 (= the external VGA monitor). By default,
	the driver will use CRT1 if a monitor is detected during server
	start. Some older monitors can't be detected, so they may require
	setting this option to true. To disable CRT1 output, set this option
	to false.
<tag>Option "ForceCRT1Type"</tag>
 	SiS 650, M650 and 651 with either 301LV or 302LV video bridge only.
	May be VGA or LCD. Specifying LCD will force the driver to use the
	VGA controller's CRT1 channel for driving the LCD, while CRT2 is
	free for TV usage. Default is VGA.
<tag>Option "ForceCRT2Type"</tag>
    Selects the CRT2 output device type. Valid parameters are LCD, TV,
	SVIDEO, COMPOSITE, SCART, VGA, NONE. NONE disables CRT2. SVIDEO and
	COMPOSITE are only for systems with a SiS video bridge and select the
	desired plug type. For Chrontel systems, TV should be used instead.
	VGA means secondary VGA and is only available on some SiS video bridges
	(301, 301B, 301C).
<tag>Option "CRT2Gamma"</tag>
    Enables or disables gamma correction for CRT2. This is only supported
	for SiS video bridges. Default: gamma correction for CRT2 is enabled.
<tag>Option "DRI"</tag>
	Although this option is accepted for all chipsets, it currently only
	makes sense on the 300 series; DRI is only supported on these chipsets.
	This option enables/disables DRI.
<tag>Option "TVStandard"</tag>
	Selects the TV output standard. May be PAL or NTSC, on some machines
	(depending on the hardware) also PALM and PALN. Default: BIOS setting.
<tag>Option "TVXPosOffset", "TVYPosOffset"</tag>
	These options allow relocating the image on your TV. Both options take
	an integer within the range of -16 to 16. Default: 0. Not supported for
	Chrontel 7019.
<tag>Option "CHTVOverscan"</tag>
	For Chrontel TV encoders only. Selects whether TV output should be
	overscan or underscan.
<tag>Option "CHTVSuperOverscan"</tag>
	For Chrontel 7005 TV encoders in PAL mode only. Selects whether TV output
	should be super-overscan (slightly larger than the viewable area) or
	not.
<tag> Option "SISTVXScale", "SISTVYScale"</tag>
	For SiS video bridges only. These options allow zooming the image on
	your TV. SISTVXScale takes an integer within the range of -16 to 16.
	SISTVYScale accepts -4 to 3. Default: 0. Not all modes can be scaled.
</descrip>

<sect1> 300 series specific options<p>

<descrip>
<tag>Option "MaxXFBMem"</tag>
	DRI requires the linux kernel's SiS framebuffer driver "sisfb" and some
	other modules which come with either the linux kernel or XFree86. (On *BSD,
	the DRI driver does not require any framebuffer driver.)
  	Sisfb takes care of memory management for texture data. In order to prevent
	the X driver and sisfb from overwriting each others video memory, sisfb
	reserves an amount of video memory for the X driver. This amount can either
	be selected using sisfb's mem parameter, or auto-selected depending on the
	amount of total video RAM available. However, the X driver needs to know about
	the amount of RAM sisfb reserved. For this purpose, the Option "MaxXFBMem" exists.

	XFree 4.3.0 disabled SiS DRI support due to a lack of maintenance of the SiS DRI
	driver. XFree86 4.4 contains a newly written SiS DRI driver by Eric Anholt.

	If you intend to use DRI, I recommend setting the total video memory in the BIOS
	to 64MB in order to at least overcome the lack of memory swap functions.

	Sisfb can be used for memory management only, or as a complete framebuffer driver.
	If you start sisfb with a valid mode (ie you gain a graphical console), the X driver
	can communicate with sisfb and doesn't require setting the MaxXFBMem option at all.
	The X driver will receive enough information from sisfb in this case.

	However, if you use sisfb for memory management only, ie you started sisfb with
	mode=none and still have a text mode console, there is no communication between sisfb
	and the X driver. In this case, you need to set MaxXFBMem to the same value as you
	gave sisfb with its mem parameter. If you didn't specify any mem parameter, sisfb
	will reserve 12288KB if more than 16MB of total video RAM is available, 8192KB if
	between 12 and 16MB of video RAM is available, 4096KB in all other cases.

	Then you need to specify any of these amounts as the parameter for the MaxXFBMem
	option. The value is to be given without 'KB'.
</descrip>

<sect1> 315/330 series specific options<p>

<descrip>
<tag>Option "RenderAcceleration"</tag>
	Enables or disables RENDER acceleration. By default, RENDER acceleration
	is enabled.
<tag>Option "XvOnCRT2"</tag>
	315, 650, 740, 330 only. This option selects whether the XVideo (Xv)
	overlay should be displayed on CRT1 or CRT2. Setting this options
	means CRT2. The other CRT will only display the (blue) color key.

This driver needs linear framebuffer support in the card. Because this 
SiS 86C201 and 86C202 based cards don't work with this driver.

Color expansion is not supported by the engine in 16M-color graphic mode.

<tag>Option "SetMclk"</tag>
        This option lets you to modify the memory clocking of your card.
    (only for 5597 and 6326) Modifying the memory timings can destroy the 
	device, but usually the only ill effects of overclocking is to 
	have some noise an drawing errors, but BE CAREFUL. Usually a little 
	increment can improve the drawing speed, and allows also higher dotclocks. 
	The server reports default memclock on starting messages, so take it
	as a base. Units are in KHZ.
<tag>Option "DacSpeed"</tag>
        This option lets you to modify the maximum allowed dotclock).	
<tag>Option "sw_cursor", "hw_cursor"</tag>
	The default is for using the hardware cursor.
<!-- Which of these chips is even supported? -->

	5597/8 and 6326 have the option to extend the engine command queue on
	VRAM. With extended queue length, the driver only checks queue status 
	on some color-expansion commands. This gives some performance improvement, 
	but is possible to lose some commands, corrupting screen output. As the 
	size of extended command queue is 16-32K, the probability is very low, but
	exists. The performance gain observed is around 8-10%. Currently, using
	this option will occasionally freeze the acceleration engine, causing 
	weird image display.
<tag>Option "FastVram"</tag>
        Enables 1 cycle memory access. Try it. Increased memory bandwidth reduces
	the possibility of glitches and noise on high resolution modes.

<tag>VideoRAM size</tag> The SiS chips can only directly address 4096K
        bytes of video RAM.  Some video cards using these chips are
        shipped with additional video RAM.  The videoRAM must be
        explicitly limited to 4096 for those cards.  Attempting to use
        the additional RAM leads to a variety of scrambled screen
        artifacts.

<sect> Modelines <p>

a190 22
When constructing a modeline for use with the Sis
driver you'll need to consider several points:
<itemize>
  <item>H/W Acceleration.  The H/W cursor, and fill operations
	currently allocate memory of the video ram for there own use.
	If this is not available these functions will automatically be
	disabled. Also, Turboqueue allocate 32k of Vram. 
  <item>Dot Clock. SiS documents the following video modes to work with 
        6326. The max dot clock allowable for your 6326 based board depends 
	also on the memory installed on it. Option FastVram can be needed 
	for high dot clocks to work. Of course, the memory installed must
	allow 1 cycle R/W. 
	<p>
        SiS recommended video modes for 6326: 
	<descrip>
         <tag>640x480 :</tag>4, 8, 15, 16, 24 bpp at 85Hz Non-interlaced
         <tag>800x600 :</tag>4, 8, 15, 16, 24 bpp at 85Hz Non-interlaced

<!-- don't have XF86Setup for 4.0
The generic VGA driver don't work with 6326, so XF86Setup can't be used
for this card. Please use xf86config instead.
-->

Some video modes with high dot-clocks don't work at all, resulting on black 
screen. Lowering dotclock in that case could solve the problem.

log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

<tag>Option "ForceCRT2Type"</tag>
    Selects the CRT2 output device type. Valid parameters are LCD, TV,
	SVIDEO, COMPOSITE, SCART, VGA, NONE. NONE disables CRT2. SVIDEO and
	COMPOSITE are only for systems with a SiS video bridge and select the
	desired plug type. For Chrontel systems, TV should be used instead.
	VGA means secondary VGA and is only available on some SiS video bridges
	(301, 301B, 301C).
<tag>Option "CRT2Gamma"</tag>
    Enables or disables gamma correction for CRT2. This is only supported
	for SiS video bridges. Default: gamma correction for CRT2 is enabled.
<tag>Option "DRI"</tag>
	Although this option is accepted for all chipsets, it currently only
	makes sense on the 300 series; DRI is only supported on these chipsets.
	This option enables/disables DRI.
<tag>Option "TVStandard"</tag>
	Selects the TV output standard. May be PAL or NTSC, on some machines
	(depending on the hardware) also PALM and PALN. Default: BIOS setting.
<tag>Option "TVXPosOffset", "TVYPosOffset"</tag>
	These options allow relocating the image on your TV. Both options take
	an integer within the range of -16 to 16. Default: 0. Not supported for
	Chrontel 7019.
<tag>Option "CHTVOverscan"</tag>
	For Chrontel TV encoders only. Selects whether TV output should be
	overscan or underscan.
<tag>Option "CHTVSuperOverscan"</tag>
	For Chrontel 7005 TV encoders in PAL mode only. Selects whether TV output
	should be super-overscan (slightly larger than the viewable area) or
	not.
<tag> Option "SISTVXScale", "SISTVYScale"</tag>
	For SiS video bridges only. These options allow zooming the image on

<tag>Option "MaxXFBMem"</tag>
	DRI requires the linux kernel's SiS framebuffer driver "sisfb" and some
	other modules which come with either the linux kernel or XFree86. (On *BSD,
	the DRI driver does not require any framebuffer driver.)
  	Sisfb takes care of memory management for texture data. In order to prevent
	the X driver and sisfb from overwriting each others video memory, sisfb
	reserves an amount of video memory for the X driver. This amount can either
	be selected using sisfb's mem parameter, or auto-selected depending on the
	amount of total video RAM available. However, the X driver needs to know about
	the amount of RAM sisfb reserved. For this purpose, the Option "MaxXFBMem" exists.

	XFree 4.3.0 disabled SiS DRI support due to a lack of maintainance of the SiS DRI
	driver. XFree86 4.4 contains a newly written SiS DRI driver by Eric Anholt.

	If you intend to use DRI, I recommend setting the total video memory in the BIOS
	to 64MB in order to at least overcome the lack of memory swap functions.

	Sisfb can be used for memory management only, or as a complete framebuffer driver.
	If you start sisfb with a valid mode (ie you gain a graphical console), the X driver
	can communicate with sisfb and doesn't require setting the MaxXFBMem option at all.
	The X driver will receive enough information from sisfb in this case.

	However, if you use sisfb for memory management only, ie you started sisfb with
	mode=none and still have a text mode console, there is no communication between sisfb
	and the X driver. In this case, you need to set MaxXFBMem to the same value as you
	gave sisfb with its mem parameter. If you didn't specify any mem parameter, sisfb
	will reserve 12288KB if more than 16MB of total video RAM is available, 8192KB if
	between 12 and 16MB of video RAM is available, 4096KB in all other cases.

	Then you need to specify any of these amounts as the parameter for the MaxXFBMem

This driver is written by Thomas Winischhofer and is a (nearly) complete re-write
of a driver written for the SiS6326 and SiS530 by Alan Hourihane and others.
d24 1
a24 1
It currently supports the following chipsets:
d26 5
a30 4
   <item>old series: 5597/5598, 6236/AGP/DVD, 530/620
   <item>300 series: 300/305, 540, 630/730
   <item>315 series: 315, 550, 650, 651, M650, 740
   <item>330 series: 330 ("Xabre"), 661FX, M661FX, 741, 760
d33 9
a41 12
The driver supports:
<itemize>
  <item>8/16/24 bits color depth; old series also 15;
  <item>XAA (XFree86 Acceleration Architecture)
  <item>XVideo (Xv)
  <item>Render (XRAND)
  <item>Hardware cursor; 315/330 series: Color HW cursor;
  <item>6326: TV output
  <item>300/315/330 series: TV output via Chrontel TV encoders or SiS video bridges
  <item>300/315/330 series: LCD output via LVDS transmitters or SiS video bridges
  <item>300/315/330 series: Dual head mode; Xinerama; Merged framebuffer mode;
</itemize>
d43 2
a44 4
This document gives an overview over the driver's features and configuration options.
Please see http://www.winischhofer.net/linuxsisvga.shtml for detailed documentation
and updates. Support for the 661, 741 and 760 is entirely untested as of this writing,
and possibly incomplete for LCD output.

<sect1>For all chipsets<p>

d53 13
a65 5
<tag>Option "SWCursor", "HWCursor"</tag>
	These options select whether the software (SW) or hardware (HW) cursor should
	be used. The default is using the hardware cursor.
<tag>Option "NoAccel"</tag>
        Disables 2D acceleration. Default: 2D acceleration is enabled.
d67 11
a77 15
	SiS chipsets have the option to extend the engine command queue on
	VRAM. This concept is called "TurboQueue" and gives some performance improvement.
	Due to hardware bugs, the TurboQueue is disabled on the 530/620, otherwise
	enabled by default.
<tag>Option "Rotate"</tag>
        This option enables clockwise ("CW") or counter-clockwise ("CCW") rotation of
	the display. Enabling either CW or CCW rotation disables the RandR extension.
	Default: no rotation.
<tag>Option "ShadowFB"</tag>
        This option enables the shadow framebuffer layer. By default, it is disabled.
<tag>Option "NoXVideo"</tag>
        Disables the XVideo support. Default: XVideo support is enabled.
<tag>Option "CRT1Gamma"</tag>
        Enables or disables gamma correction. Default: gamma correction is enabled.

<tag>Option "FastVram"</tag>
        Enables 1 cycle memory access for read and write operations. The default
	depends on the chipset used.
<tag>Option "NoHostBus"</tag>
        For 5597/5598 only. This option, if set, disables the CPU to VGA host bus.
	Disabling the host bus will result in a severe performance regression.
<tag>VideoRAM size</tag> The SiS 6326 can only directly address 4096K
        bytes of video RAM. However, there are some cards out there featuring
	8192K (8MB) of video RAM. This RAM is not addressable by the engines.
	Therefore, by default, the driver will only use 4096K. This behavior
	can be overridden by specifying the amount of video RAM using the
	VideoRAM keyword. If more than 4096K is specified, the driver will
	disable 2D acceleration, Xv and the HW cursor. On all other chipsets,
	this keyword is ignored.
<tag>Option "NoYV12"</tag>
        Due to hardware bugs, XVideo may display a corrupt image when using
	YV12 encoded material. This option, if set, disables support for YV12
	and hence forces the Xv-aware application to use either YUV2 or XShm
	for video output.
<tag>Option "TVStandard"</tag>
	(6326 only) Selects the TV output standard. May be PAL or NTSC. By default,
	this is selected by a jumper on the card.

<tag>Option "ForceCRT1"</tag>
        Enables or disables CRT1 (= the external VGA monitor). By default,
	the driver will use CRT1 if a monitor is detected during server
	start. Some older monitors can't be detected, so they may require
	setting this option to true. To disable CRT1 output, set this option
	to false.
<tag>Option "ForceCRT1Type"</tag>
 	SiS 650, M650 and 651 with either 301LV or 302LV video bridge only.
	May be VGA or LCD. Specifying LCD will force the driver to use the
	VGA controller's CRT1 channel for driving the LCD, while CRT2 is
	free for TV usage. Default is VGA.
<tag>Option "ForceCRT2Type"</tag>
    Selects the CRT2 output device type. Valid parameters are LCD, TV,
	SVIDEO, COMPOSITE, SCART, VGA, NONE. NONE disables CRT2. SVIDEO and
	COMPOSITE are only for systems with a SiS video bridge and select the

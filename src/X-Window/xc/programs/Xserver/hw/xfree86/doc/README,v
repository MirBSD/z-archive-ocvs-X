@                        README for XFree86[tm] 4.4.0

                          The XFree86 Project, Inc

                              23 February 2004

                                  Abstract

     XFree86 is an Open Source version of the X Window System that sup-
     ports many UNIX(R) and UNIX-like operating systems (such as Linux,
     FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and Solaris x86) on Intel and other plat-
     forms.  This version is compatible with X11R6.6.

1.  What is XFree86 4.4.0?

XFree86 4.4.0 is the seventh full release in the XFree86 4.x series.

XFree86 4.x is the current XFree86 release series.  The first release in this
series was in early 2000.  The core of XFree86 4.x is a modular X server.
The 4.4.0 version is a new release that includes additional hardware support,
functional enhancements and bug fixes.  Specific release enhancements can be
viewed in the Release Notes.

Most modern PC video hardware is supported in XFree86 4.4.0, and most PC
video hardware that isn't supported explicitly can be used with the "vesa"
driver.  The Releaes Notes has a table showing the drivers provided with
XFree86 4.4.0, and links to related documentation.

XFree86[tm] is produced by The XFree86 Project, Inc through the work of a
group of volunteer independent developers.  The XFree86 Project is a non-com-
mercial organisation and XFree86 would not exist without the invaluable
development contributions of volunteers from around the world.  This release
is dedicated to the greater XFree86 community, developers and users alike.

future releases.  New works should be discussed on our <devel@@XFree86.org>
list prior to submission.

Current information about the XFree86 development process can be found at our
web site <URL:http://www.xfree86.org/developer.html>.

6.  How to get XFree86 4.4.0

XFree86 4.4.0 can be found at the XFree86 ftp server
<URL:ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/XFree86/4.4.0/>, and at mirrors of this
server.  Information about obtaining and installing binary distributions of
this release can be found in the Installation Document.  Information about
obtaining the release in source form is given below.

The source for version 4.4.0 is split into seven tarballs:

     XFree86-4.4.0-src-1.tgz
     XFree86-4.4.0-src-2.tgz
     XFree86-4.4.0-src-3.tgz
     XFree86-4.4.0-src-4.tgz
     XFree86-4.4.0-src-5.tgz
     XFree86-4.4.0-src-6.tgz
     XFree86-4.4.0-src-7.tgz

The first three contain everything except the fonts and general X11 documen-
tation.  Those three are sufficient for building XFree86 if you already have
a set of fonts.  The fourth and fifth contain the fonts.  The sixth contains
the source for the general X11 documentation.  The seventh contains the gen-
eral X11 documentation in hardcopy format.

A source patch relative to version 4.3.0 is also available.  Because of its
size, it is split into four parts.  The patch files are:

     XFree86-4.3.0-4.4.0.diff1.gz
     XFree86-4.3.0-4.4.0.diff2.gz
     XFree86-4.3.0-4.4.0.diff3.gz
     XFree86-4.3.0-4.4.0.diff4.gz

There is also a tarball and a cleanup script that handle files that have com-
ponents that can't be included in a diff.  These are:

     XFree86-4.3.0-4.4.0-diff0.tgz
     XFree86-4.3.0-4.4.0-cleanup.sh

These patches should be applied to a clean 4.3.0 source tree, working from
the directory containing the xc/ directory.  The patches should be applied by
running:

     gzip -d < XFree86-4.3.0-4.4.0.diff1.gz | patch -p0 -E
     gzip -d < XFree86-4.3.0-4.4.0.diff2.gz | patch -p0 -E
     gzip -d < XFree86-4.3.0-4.4.0.diff3.gz | patch -p0 -E
     gzip -d < XFree86-4.3.0-4.4.0.diff4.gz | patch -p0 -E

     sh XFree86-4.3.0-4.4.0-cleanup.sh
     gzip -d < XFree86-4.3.0-4.4.0-diff0.tgz | tar vxf -

To format the XFree86 documentation use the latest version of our doctools
package available from the XFree86 CVS repository's "doctools" module, and
from our ftp site <URL:ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/XFree86/misc/doc-
tools-1.3.2.tgz>.

The XFree86 source code for this and all releases/snapshots as well as devel-
opment versions can also be accessed via the XFree86 CVS repository.  Infor-
mation about accessing this can be found at the CVS page
<URL:http://www.xfree86.org/cvs/> on our web site.  It's also possible to
browse the XFree86 CVS repository at our CVSWeb server
<URL:http://cvsweb.xfree86.org/>.  The CVS tag for this version is
"xf-4_4_0".  The CVS tag for the stable branch for this release is
"xf-4_4-branch".  To check out the latest development version, don't specify
any tag.

     XFree86 is the Open Source port of X.Org's X11R6.6 release that
     supports several UNIX(R) and UNIX-like (such as Linux, the BSDs and
     Solaris x86) operating systems on Intel and other platforms.

1.  What is XFree86 4.2.1?

XFree86 4.2.1 is the first update to 4.2.0, the fifth full release in the
XFree86 4 series.

Update releases are taken from a stable/maintenance branch.  They are
designed to be installed on top of the full release that they are updating.
They contain fixes for serious problems, most commonly fixes for security
issues, fixes for driver bugs, and fixes that improve stability.

XFree86 release 4 is a major re-design of the basic architectural underpin-
nings of XFree86's implementation of the original X Consortium's X Server.
This re-design allows for a modular interaction between the hardware drivers
and the XFree86 core X server.  With 4.x, upgrades to the X server with new
and unsupported hardware can be easily done and installed without undergoing
the previous process of rebuilding an X server.  All that is required is
installing the new driver module and updating the configuration file.

The road to XFree86 release 4 began as an architectural concept in mid 1997,
with the serious framework being implemented in code the beginning of 1998.
There were several snapshots on the road to 4.0 which are now part of the 4.0
base release.

Release 4 also included the long-awaited integration of the DRI (Direct Ren-
dering Infrastructure).  This upgrade into the code base  gives XFree86 the
abilities of accelerated direct 3-D graphics rendering, used widely in games
and other visualization programs.

While some driver available in the old 3.3.x release series have not been
converted over to the 4.x series, those required for most modern video hard-
ware are available.  Please check the Driver Status document first to see
whether your hardware is supported before upgrading to the 4.x series.

Specific release enhancements can be viewed in the Release Notes.

The XFree86 version numbering system has had some changes as of the 4.0.2
release.  Information about this can be found in the Versions Document.

2.  Joining The Team

2.1  Development
d75 3
a77 36
If you would like to work on the development of XFree86 4, either by helping
with the conversion of our older drivers to the new 4.x design, or assisting
in the addition of new drivers or platforms to the code base then send a
request to join the XFree86 development team
<URL:http://www.xfree86.org:/developer.html>.  This will give you direct
access to the latest XFree86 related development topics and discussions.
Include in your note, your name, email address, reason for joining (what you
will work on) and, level of expertise (coder, DRI, core, specific driver) and
area of interest.

2.2  Documentation

If instead your interests are on the Documentation side of the Project, or
you want to contribute and are not ready for plunging into the code, you can
join the Documentation Team (those hardy souls responsible for the content
you are reading :-).  Amongst the Doc Team's activities are converting our
SGML based documentation into an XML based one and updating and creating
technical documentation used by staff and public.  If this sounds interesting
then please send a request to join the XFree86 documentation team
<URL:mailto:signup@@xfree86.org>.  Include in your note, you name, email
address, reason for joining (what you will work on) and level of expertise
and whether you are interested in the tools or content side of the group.

3.  The Public Mailing Lists

3.1  Newbie

For those who are new to XFree86  and want to learn more about our Project we
recommend that you join our Newbie list, located at Public Mailing Lists
<URL:http://www.xfree86.org/mailman/listinfo>, where this and other discus-
sions occur with our senior all-volunteer staff.  This is great forum to get
introduced to XFree86 and ask for help on how to set up the XServer or
whether your hardware is supported, and why not?,  and make suggestions for
future releases of XFree86.  This list is supported by our volunteer staff
who needs to know how you are using and interacting with XFree86 and what is
wrong and could be better.  Tell them, they want to know!
d79 1

3.2  Announce

a103 11
If instead you are the lone developer who is improving XFree86 on an ad hoc
basis for your particular environment (I want to get my mouse or video card
to work), and need a specific question asked then you should go over to our
Xpert list where such questions are raised and answered by our technical
development staff.  Remember you do not have to be a member to write fixes to
our code base and if your changes are discrete and self-contained the volume
of developer mail may just be too noisy.

Once your work is finished (coded, debugged and documented) please send your
fix to <fixes@@XFree86.org>.  This will ensure that they are included in
future releases. And thanks!  You make this truly an Open group.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

XFree86 4.4.0 can be found at the XFree86 ftp server
<URL:ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/XFree86/4.4.0/>, and at mirrors of this
server.  Information about obtaining and installing binary distributions of
this release can be found in the Installation Document.  Information about
obtaining the release in source form is given below.

The source for version 4.4.0 is split into seven tarballs:

     XFree86-4.4.0-src-1.tgz
     XFree86-4.4.0-src-2.tgz
     XFree86-4.4.0-src-3.tgz
     XFree86-4.4.0-src-4.tgz
     XFree86-4.4.0-src-5.tgz
     XFree86-4.4.0-src-6.tgz
     XFree86-4.4.0-src-7.tgz

The first three contain everything except the fonts and general X11 documen-
tation.  Those three are sufficient for building XFree86 if you already have
a set of fonts.  The fourth and fifth contain the fonts.  The sixth contains
the source for the general X11 documentation.  The seventh contains the gen-
eral X11 documentation in hardcopy format.

A source patch relative to version 4.3.0 is also available.  Because of its
size, it is split into four parts.  The patch files are:

     XFree86-4.3.0-4.4.0.diff1.gz
     XFree86-4.3.0-4.4.0.diff2.gz
     XFree86-4.3.0-4.4.0.diff3.gz
     XFree86-4.3.0-4.4.0.diff4.gz

There is also a tarball and a cleanup script that handle files that have com-
ponents that can't be included in a diff.  These are:

     XFree86-4.3.0-4.4.0-diff0.tgz
     XFree86-4.3.0-4.4.0-cleanup.sh

These patches should be applied to a clean 4.3.0 source tree, working from
the directory containing the xc/ directory.  The patches should be applied by
running:

     gzip -d < XFree86-4.3.0-4.4.0.diff1.gz | patch -p0 -E
     gzip -d < XFree86-4.3.0-4.4.0.diff2.gz | patch -p0 -E
     gzip -d < XFree86-4.3.0-4.4.0.diff3.gz | patch -p0 -E
     gzip -d < XFree86-4.3.0-4.4.0.diff4.gz | patch -p0 -E

     sh XFree86-4.3.0-4.4.0-cleanup.sh
     gzip -d < XFree86-4.3.0-4.4.0-diff0.tgz | tar vxf -

To format the XFree86 documentation use the latest version of our doctools
package available from the XFree86 CVS repository's "doctools" module, and

     XFree86 is an Open Source version of the X Window System that sup-
     ports many UNIX(R) and UNIX-like operating systems (such as Linux,
     FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and Solaris x86) on Intel and other plat-
     forms.  This version is compatible with X11R6.6.

1.  What is XFree86 4.3.0?

XFree86 4.3.0 is the sixth full release in the XFree86 4.x series.

XFree86 4.x is the current XFree86 release series.  The first release in this
series was in early 2000.  The core of XFree86 4.x is a modular X server.
The 4.3.0 version is a new release that includes additional hardware support,
functional enhancements and bug fixes.  Specific release enhancements can be
viewed in the Release Notes.

Most modern PC video hardware is supported in XFree86 4.3.0, and most PC
video hardware that isn't supported explicitly can be used with the "vesa"
driver.  The Driver Status document has a summary of what hardware is sup-
ported in 4.3.0 compared with the old 3.3.x (3.3.6) series.  It is a good
idea to check there before upgrading if you are currently running 3.3.6 with
older hardware.

XFree86 is produced by The XFree86 Project, Inc, which is a group of mostly
volunteer independent developers.  XFree86 is a non-commercial organisation,
and would not be viable without the invaluable development contributions of
volunteers.  This release is dedicated to all who have supported and con-
tributed to XFree86 over the last eleven years.

2.  Pointers to additional information

The documentation for this release can be found online at the XFree86 web
site <URL:http://www.xfree86.org/4.3.0/>.  Documentation for the latest
release version can always be found here <URL:http://www.xfree86.org/cur-
rent/>, and documentation for the latest pre-release snapshot can be found
here <URL:http://www.xfree86.org/snapshot/>.  Checking those last two links
is a good way of finding out the latest versions available from XFree86.

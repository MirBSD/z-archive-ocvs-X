@                  Information for DEC 21030 Users (aka TGA)

                          The XFree86 Project, Inc.

                               March 5th, 2000

1.  DEC 21030

   o The DEC 21030 is supported by XFree86 4.4.0.  The driver is now par-
     tially accelerated.  The built-in graphics on the Multia is supported in
     8-plane mode, and PCI cards with 8 or 16 MB framebuffers are supported
     in 24-plane mode.  TGA2 (aka PowerStorm 3D30/4D20) cards are not cur-
     rently supported.

   o Current Known Problems

       1.  Virtual desktops and multiple modelines do not work.  You should
           specify only one modeline.

       2.  Hardware cursor is only supported on systems with the BT485 ram-
           dac, ie the Multia.

       3.  After the server has been run using the hardware cursor, the Linux
           TGA console cursor (which also uses the hardware cursor) is
           shifted down by one pixel. This problem does not affect Linux ker-
           nels 2.2.10 and above, which do not use the hardware cursor.

       4.  The XAA PolySegment() method is buggy. If you experience server
           crashes with SIGFPE, or server hangs, try disabling it (see
           below).

   o The following options may be specified for the 21030 driver:

           BusID "PCI:?:??:?"
                 Currently it is necessary to specify the BusID so that the
                 server will find the card.  Check /proc/pci and look for the
                 bus, device, and function numbers in the 21030 section.  On
                 a Multia, this should be "PCI:0:11:0".

           MemBase 0x???????
                 If the server does not detect the base address of the 21030,
                 then check /proc/pci for the 21030 and look for the
                 "Prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0x???????" and enter this as
                 your MemBase setting.

           Option "NoAccel"
                 Disables acceleration.

           Option "swcursor"
                 Disables the hardware cursor.

           Option "NoXaaPolySegment"
                 Disables the XAA PolySegment() method.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

   o The DEC 21030 is supported by XFree86 4.3.99.903.  The driver is now
     partially accelerated.  The built-in graphics on the Multia is supported
     in 8-plane mode, and PCI cards with 8 or 16 MB framebuffers are sup-
     ported in 24-plane mode.  TGA2 (aka PowerStorm 3D30/4D20) cards are not
     currently supported.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

<sect>Configuration
<p>
The driver auto-detects all device information necessary to
initialize the card.  The only lines you need in the "Device"
section of your XF86Config file are:
<verb>
       Section "Device"
           Identifier "Intel i740"
           Driver     "i740"
       EndSection
</verb>
or let <tt>xf86config</tt> do this for you.

However, if you have problems with auto-detection, you can specify:
<itemize>
  <item>VideoRam - in kilobytes
  <item>DacSpeed - in MHz
  <item>MemBase  - physical address of the linear framebuffer
  <item>IOBase   - physical address of the memory mapped IO registers
</itemize>


<sect>Driver Options
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>"NoAccel"  - Turn off hardware acceleration
  <item>"SWCursor" - Request a software cursor (hardware is default)
  <item>"SDRAM"    - Force the use of SDRAM timings
  <item>"SGRAM"    - Force the use of SGRAM timings
  <item>"SlowRam"  - Force the use of slower ram timings
  <item>"Dac6Bit"  - Force the use of a 6 Bit Dac (8 Bit is the default)
  <item>"UsePIO    - Force the use of programmed IO (Memory mapped is the default)
</itemize>

Note: the i740 X server should automatically detect whether your
card has SGRAM or SDRAM.  Use the "sgram" and "sdram" options
if it is incorrectly detected.


<sect>Known Limitations
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>Certain drawing operations are very slow when using 24 bit
        pixel depth mode.
</itemize>

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

1.1.1.1
log
@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

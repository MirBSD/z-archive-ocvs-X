@                     README for XFree86 4.4.0 on LynxOS

                               Thomas Mueller

                              25 February 2000

1.  What and Where is XFree86?

XFree86 is a port of X11R6.4 that supports several versions of Intel-based
Unix.  It is derived from X386 1.2, which was the X server distributed with
X11R5.  This release consists of many new features and performance improve-
ments as well as many bug fixes.

See the Copyright Notice.

The sources for XFree86 4.4.0 are available by anonymous ftp from:

ftp://ftp.XFree86.org/pub/XFree86/4.4.0

Binaries of XFree86 for LynxOS x86 are available from:

ftp://ftp.XFree86.org/pub/XFree86/4.4.0/binaries/LynxOS

A list of mirror sites is provided by ftp://ftp.XFree86.org/pub/XFree86/MIR-
RORS

The binaries on the FTP site were built on the latest released LynxOS version
at the time XFree86 4.4.0 was released. In this case it is `LynxOS x86
3.0.1'. Because of changes made to the object format they don't run on LynxOS
versions earlier than 3.0.0.

Building of this XFree86 version has never been tested on LynxOS versions
earlier than 2.5.1.

This release contains preliminary build support for `LynxOS 3.1.0'.  Since
this OS release was not available long enough for serious testing `LynxOS
3.1.0' support has to be considered to be in `alpha state'.  Initial tests
were performed on LynxOS x86 only!

XFree86 4.4.0 supports LynxOS on the x86 and on the PowerPC platform. X
servers are currently available only on the x86 platform. The X server may
work with some PowerPC platforms supported by LynxOS though this has not
(yet) been thoroughly tested.

If you need binaries for other platforms than the one on the XFree86 FTP
server or if you have comments or suggestions about this document contact me
(<tmueller@@sysgo.de>).

2.  Installing the Binaries

Please refer to the Installation Document for detailed installation instruc-
tions.

It may be necessary to increase the process stack limit in order to run
XFree86 on your system. Edit /etc/startab and reboot your system to make the
changes active before you begin the installation.

Also, be sure to include /usr/X11R6/bin in your PATH environment variable.

Refer to the next section Running XFree86 (section 3., page 1) for further
information on necessary configuration steps before running XFree86 on
LynxOS.

2.1  Accessing XFree86 manual pages

Include /usr/X11R6/man in the MANPATH environment variable or add the direc-
tory /usr/X11R6/man to /usr/Lib/man.config

3.  Running XFree86

This section describes the changes to the LynxOS environment which may be
necessary to successfully run XFree86.

3.1  System tuning

3.1.1  Tunable parameters

To reasonably run XFree86 you may have to adjust a few system parameters.

On LynxOS 2.5.x and 3.0.x include a line

     #define X_WINDOWS

in /sys/lynx.os/uparam.h.

3.1.2  Adjustment for "nv" driver for NVidia graphics cards

If you're using the "nv" driver (Riva 128, nVidia TNT, TNT2, GeForce), you
will have to increase the value of the SMEMS parameter in
/sys/lynx.os/uparam.h from 10 to 20.

3.1.3  Increase number of ptys

You should also increase the number of ptys to be able run a couple more
xterms. You may replace /sys/cfg/pty.cfg with /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/etc/pty.cfg.

3.1.4  MTRR device driver

If you're using an Intel PentiumPRO or Pentium II (or higher) class CPU you
might want to install the MTRR device driver. This driver enables the XFree86
X server to manipulate the CPU memory type range registers which may improve
performance on certain systems.

To install the driver (on LynxOS x86 2.5.0 systems an higher) follow these
steps:

       # cd /
       # bash /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/etc/MTRR-Lynx.shar
       # cd sys/drivers/mtrr
       # make install

Then add a line

       I:../drivers/mtrr/mtrr.cfg

to /sys/lynx.os/CONFIG.TBL and rebuild the kernel (see next section).

3.1.5  Kernel build

If you plan to use a PS/2 mouse to the following sections before rebuilding
the kernel, if not, you should rebuild the kernel now:

          # cd /sys/lynx.os
          # make install
          # reboot -N

3.2  Mouse support in XFree86

XFree86 includes support for PnP mice (see also Mouse Support in XFree86).
The current LynxOS TTY device driver doesn't allow the necessary manipulation
of the RTS line and therefore the support for PnP mice has been disabled for
LynxOS.

3.3  PS/2 mouse drivers

LynxOS x86 comes with a PS/2 mouse driver. If it is not currently installed
on your system install it with /usr/bin/Install.ps2mouse. Older versions of
this driver contained code to translate the PS/2 mouse protocol to the format
of a serial mouse, thus you'll have to specify "Microsoft" as the mouse pro-
tocol format. The mouse driver contained in LynxOS x86 patchlevel 015 (and
higher) does no longer perform the protocol translation an therefore can be
defined as "PS/2" protocol format.

3.4  ATC console driver and VT switching

Currently there is no support for virtual terminal switching once the server
has started. Support for this feature may be added in future versions (it
requires a patch to the vt100 LynxOS terminal driver).

You will need a free console which the X server will use for keyboard input.
You must disable login on at least one of the four virtual terminals in
/etc/ttys, e.g. /dev/atc3:

change

            /dev/atc3:1:default:vt100at:/bin/login

to

            /dev/atc3:0:default:vt100at:/bin/login
                      ^

3.5  X Server debug diagnostics output and other VT peculiarities

Output made by the XFree86 X on its stdout or stderr will be lost after the
server switches to graphics mode. The XFree86 4.4.0 server stores its output
in /usr/adm/XFree86.n.log (where n is the screen number).

When the X server is running output made to other consoles will be lost.
After server shutdown the screen contents of other consoles may be inconsis-
tent with what one would expect (i.e. random).

4.  Compiling the XFree86 Distribution

The next sections contain LynxOS specific notes with respect to the build
process.

4.1  Disk space requirements

Currently there is no support for shared libraries in the LynxOS XFree86
port. A complete binary installation along with manual pages will require
approximately 100 MBytes of disk space. To compile the system you will need
at least 250 MBytes of free disk space.

4.2  Changes to system environment (LynxOS x86)

Before compiling the XFree86 distribution you will have to make a few little
adjustments to your system:

   o If not already installed on your system create a shell script named
     /lib/cpp as follows:

            #!/bin/sh
            /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-unknown-lynxos2.5/2.7-96q1/cpp \
               -traditional "$@@"

     On other platforms than the x86 the paths for the compiler support pro-
     grams are different. You may use

            gcc -v

     to find out the correct path. Set the file mode of /lib/cpp with

            # chown root /lib/cpp
            # chmod 755 /lib/cpp

   o Modify /lib/liblynx.a. The X servers need the smem_create() system call
     to map the frame buffer into their address space. The system call is in
     liblynx library along with other Lynx proprietary calls which (unfortu-
     nately) overlap with calls in libc. To reduce confusion you should mod-
     ify liblynx as follows:

            # mv /lib/liblynx.a /lib/liblynx.a.ORG
            # mkdir /tmp/xx; cd /tmp/xx
            # ar xv /lib/liblynx.a.ORG
            # ar rv /lib/liblynx.a *smem*
            # ranlib /lib/liblynx.a

4.3  make World

If you have the MTRR device driver installed, add a line

         #define HasMTRRSupport YES

to the config/cf/host.def file.

You may then issue a

          make World

to compile XFree86. After a few hours (and hopefully a successful build of
the XFree86 system) you can install the software using

          make install

You must be logged in as super-user (root) when you invoke `make install'.

On LynxOS x86 2.5.0 you may encounter problems with make in deeply nested
subdirectories (eg core dumps, hangups). In this case update to GNU make ver-
sion 3.75 or higher.

4.4  Installing XFree86 manual pages

LynxOS uses cat-able manual pages, and because a doc preparation system is
definitely not a vital component of a real-time operating system you must
first install groff-1.09 (or newer).

XFree86 manual pages may be installed using

          make install.man

The index and whatis database for the XFree86 manual pages will be created
automatically. If you already have a whatis database or index file in the
destination directories you should perform a sort/uniq operation to remove
duplicate entries:

          for i in 1 3 5
          do
            rm -f /tmp/tmpfile
            sort /usr/X11R6/man/cat$i/LIST$i | uniq > /tmp/tmpfile
            mv /tmp/tmpfile /usr/X11R6/man/cat$i/LIST$i
          done
          sort /usr/X11R6/man/whatis | uniq > /tmp/tmpfile
          mv /tmp/tmpfile /usr/X11R6/man/whatis

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

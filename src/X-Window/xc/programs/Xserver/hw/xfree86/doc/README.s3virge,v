@                        Information for S3 ViRGE Users

                          The XFree86 Project Inc.

                                 19 Dec 2001

1.  Supported hardware

The s3virge driver in XFree86 4.4.0 supports the S3 ViRGE, ViRGE DX, GX, GX2,
MX, MX+, and VX chipsets.  It also supports Trio3D and Trio3D/2x chips.  A
majority of testing is done on ViRGE DX chips, making them the most stable to
date.  This release has added support for doublescan modes on DX.

This driver is moderately stable, however please use caution with any new
install.  Please report any problems to <XFree86@@XFree86.org> using the
appropriate bug report sheet.

2.  Features:

   o Fully accelerated support for S3 ViRGE family video adapters

   o uses linear frame buffer

   o supports resolutions up to 2048x2048

   o supports color depths of 8, 15, 16 and 24

   o full use of video card memory for acceleration caching when visible
     framebuffer leaves extra memory

   o XVideo on DX, GX, GX2, MX, MX+ and Trio3D/2X at depth 16 and 24

   o Doublescan modes on DX, possibly others (untested)

3.  Configuration:

The driver auto-detects RAM size, RAMDAC and ClockChip. Do not bother putting
these in your "Device" section.

4.  Documentation:

The driver has several supported options which are documented in the s3virge
man page.  Please refer to it for additional details about XF86Config
options.

5.  Support:

For support with XFree86 video drivers please refer to our web site at
XFree86 <URL:http://www.XFree86.org>.  For problems not addressed in the web
page please contact our support email address  <XFree86@@XFree86.org>

log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

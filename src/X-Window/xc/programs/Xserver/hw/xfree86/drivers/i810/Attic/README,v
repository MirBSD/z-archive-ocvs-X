@		      Information for i810 Users
		      i810 Driver Version 2.0.0


1. Supported Hardware

   * Intel 810 motherboards:
	i810, 
	i810-dc100, 
	i810e,
	i830m.


2. Features

   * Full support for 8, 15, 16 and 24 bit per pixel depths.
   * Hardware cursor support to reduce sprite flicker.
   * Hardware accelerated 2D drawing engine support for 8, 15, 16 and
     24 bit per pixel depths.
   * Support for high resolution video modes up to 1600x1200.
   * Fully programmable clock supported.
   * Robust text mode restore for VT switching.
   * Xv surfaces for YUV Video display and scaling.
   * XvMC hardware motion compensation for MPEG decoding.
   * Hardware accelerated 3D for i830m

3. Technical Notes

   * Hardware acceleration is not possible in 32 bit per pixel depth, 
     and this mode is not supported by this driver.
   * Interlace modes cannot be supported.
   * Normal use requires the agpgart.o module, included in linux kernels 
     2.3.42 and higher.


4. Reported Working Video Cards

   * i810, i810-dc100, i810e, i815, i815e, i830m.

5. Configuration

   The driver auto-detects all device information necessary to
   initialize the card.  The only lines you need in the "Device"
   section of your XF86Config file are:

       Section "Device"
           Identifier "i810"
	   VideoRam   16384
       EndSection

   The VideoRam option is optional and determines how much system
   memory will be used for graphics purposes. The i810 uses system
   memory for all graphics memory due to the shared memory nature
   of the chipset. 16-64MB is the recommended range depending on
   available system resources.

   If you have problems with auto-detection, you can specify:

       DacSpeed - in MHz
       MemBase  - physical address of the linear framebuffer
       IOBase   - physical address of the memory mapped IO registers


   In order to use most resolutions, it is necessary to install the
   'agpgart.o' module which accompanies this server.  You will probably
   have to compile the module yourself (see the notes in the module).

   Note: the i810 X server detects whether your motherboard has
	display cache video memory.  This memory is has reduced bandwidth
	compared to normal system memory, and isn't used by the server for
	normal operation.  The main function of this memory is for
	ancillary buffers (eg. z buffer) in a 3d capable server.


   In order to make use of the XvMC extension you will need to specify:
	Option "XvMCSurfaces" "6"
         or
	Option "XvMCSurfaces" "7"
   in the device section. Note that the memory for XvMC is preallocated and
   unavailable for general graphics use. At this time there are no generally
   available XvMC capable Mpeg decoders.


6. Driver Options

   "no_accel"  - software rendering only


7. Known Limitations

   - No 32bpp support in this driver.
   - Running Two Xservers on different VT's is not supported at this time.

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@/* $XFree86: xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/drivers/glint/README.pm3,v 1.12 2001/08/18 11:37:30 alanh Exp $ */
  
STATUS as of Tue,  8 May 2001 19:01:39 +0200
  
Working :
  * Unaccelerated : Depth 8, 15, 16 and 24 are ok. I tested them upto
    1280x1024 only as my monitor don't support higher modes.
  * Endianess clean, thanks to Romain Dolbeau <dolbeaur@@club-internet.fr> for
    helping me debug this.
  * HW cursor.
  * ShadowFb.
  * Full 2D Accels.
    - Sync.
    - Pixmap cache.
    - Offscreen pixmaps.
    - Clipping.
    - Screen to screen copy. 
    - Solid fills.
    - HorVert Solid Lines .
    - 8x8 Mono Pattern Fills.
    - Color Expansion Fills.
    - Images Writes.
    - Bitmap Writes using direct FIFO writes with or without FIFO Disconnect.
    - Pixmap Writes using direct FIFO writes with or without FIFO Disconnect.
  * Appian J2000 second head initialization.
  * Xv : Hardware video scaler :
    - Needs checking on a big endian machine.
    - Needs acceleration to work - there is a hardware bug in YV12 mode.
    - Support both dual head and single head, trough gamma or permedia3.
    - NOTE: depth 15 and 16 currently broken as I can't figure out the
      colorKey equation. From the docs it needs to be padded to 8bits per RGB,
      but that doesn't seem to work either. FIXME.
    - Attributes are :
      - FILTER : None, Partial (X only) or Full filtering.
      - COLORKEY : Speaks for itself
      - DOUBLE_BUFFER : Speaks for itself
      - AUTOPAINT_COLORKEY : Speaks for itself
      - MIRROR : X and/or Y Axis mirroring. (NOT DONE)
      - ALPHA : (NOT DONE)
        - 0 -> FB Only
        - 1 -> 25% Video, 75% FB
        - 2 -> 75% Video, 25% FB
        - 3 -> Video Only
  * DRI : Work is underway.

Not Working :

  * [NOT POSSIBLE] 2D Accel :
    - Solid & Dashed Lines are not possible on glint hardware.
    - 8x8 Color Pattern Fill is almost never used.
    - Clipping needs cleaning up.
  * [TODO] 2D Accel hooks for the Rendering extension :
    - Render extension initialization.
    - CPUToScreenTexture.
    - CPUToScreenAlphaTexture.
  * [WORK IS UNDERWAY] DRI/OpenGL (only together with a gamma chip) :
    - DRI support should be ok, but accelerated openGL is not yet supported. 
    - The accelerated OpenGL library supposes we are using a gamma together
      with a MX rasterizer, not a Permedia3 one.

Known problems :

  * [FIXED] R-B inversion. Sometimes, all of a sudden, it seems as the
    RGB order gets changed. going to console and back solves this.
    Well, this is partly fixed, but still appears under very heavy load.
 => [NOTE] If this still happens, try disabling the Hardware cursor, with
    the "SWCursor" option to your device XF86Config section.
 => [NOTE2] Or, try starting the Xserver with the -nosilk option.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B chips 
is an XFree86 driver for Chips and Technologies video processors.  The majority
of the Chips and Technologies chipsets are supported by this driver. In general
the limitation on the capabilities of this driver are determined by the 
chipset on which it is run. Where possible, this driver provides full
acceleration and supports the following depths: 1, 4, 8, 15, 16, 24 and on
the latest chipsets an 8+16 overlay mode. All visual types are supported for
depth 1, 4 and 8 and both TrueColor and DirectColor visuals are supported
where possible. Multi-head configurations are supported on PCI or AGP buses.
.SH SUPPORTED HARDWARE
The
.B chips
driver supports video processors on most of the bus types currently available.
The chipsets supported fall into one of three architectural classes. A
.B basic
architecture, the
.B WinGine
architecture and the newer
.B HiQV
architecture.
.PP
.B Basic Architecture
.PP
The supported chipsets are
.B ct65520, ct65525, ct65530, ct65535, ct65540, ct65545, ct65546
and 
.B ct65548
.PP
Color depths 1, 4 and 8 are supported on all chipsets, while depths 15, 16
and 24 are supported only on the
.B 65540, 65545, 65546
and 
.B 65548
chipsets. The driver is accelerated when used with the
.B 65545, 65546
or
.B 65548
chipsets, however the DirectColor visual is not available.
.PP
.B Wingine Architecture
.PP
The supported chipsets are
.B ct64200
and 
.B ct64300
.PP
Color depths 1, 4 and 8 are supported on both chipsets, while depths 15, 16
and 24 are supported only on the
.B 64300
chipsets. The driver is accelerated when used with the
.B 64300
chipsets, however the DirectColor visual is not available.
.PP
.B HiQV Architecture
.PP
The supported chipsets are
.B ct65550, ct65554, ct65555, ct68554, ct69000
and 
.B ct69030
.PP
Color depths 1, 4, 8, 15, 16, 24 and 8+16 are supported on all chipsets.
The DirectColor visual is supported on all color depths except the 8+16
overlay mode. Full acceleration is supplied for all chipsets.
.SH CONFIGURATION DETAILS
Please refer to XF86Config(__filemansuffix__) for general configuration
details.  This section only covers configuration details specific to this
driver.
.PP
The driver auto-detects the chipset type, but the following
.B ChipSet
names may optionally be specified in the config file
.B \*qDevice\*q
section, and will override the auto-detection:
.PP
.RS 4
"ct65520", "ct65525", "ct65530", "ct65535", "ct65540", "ct65545", "ct65546",
"ct65548", "ct65550", "ct65554", "ct65555", "ct68554", "ct69000", "ct69030",
"ct64200", "ct64300".
.RE
.PP
The driver will auto-detect the amount of video memory present for all
chipsets.  But maybe overridden with the
.B VideoRam
entry in the config file
.B \*qDevice\*q
section.
.PP
The following driver
.B Options

.BI "Option \*qNoStretch\*q \*q" boolean \*q
This option disables the stretching on a mode on a flat panel to fill the
screen. Default: off
.TP
.BI "Option \*qLcdCenter\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Center the mode displayed on the flat panel on the screen. Default: off
.TP
.BI "Option \*qHWclocks\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Force the use of fixed hardware clocks on chips that support both fixed
and programmable clocks. Default: off
.TP
.BI "Option \*qUseVclk1\*q \*q" boolean \*q

.B HiQV
chipsets instead of Vclk2. Default: off
.TP

flat panel at a specified depth
.TP
.BI "Option \*qMMIO\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Force the use of memory mapped IO for acceleration registers. Default: off
.TP
.BI "Option \*qFullMMIO\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Force the use of memory mapped IO where it can be used. Default: off
.TP
.BI "Option \*qSuspendHack\*q \*q" boolean \*q

can fix some laptop suspend/resume problems. Default: off
.TP
.BI "Option \*qOverlay\*q"
Enable 8+24 overlay mode.  Only appropriate for depth 24.  Default: off.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qColorKey\*q \*q" integer \*q
Set the colormap index used for the transparency key for the depth 8 plane
when operating in 8+16 overlay mode.  The value must be in the range
2\-255.  Default: 255.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qVideoKey\*q \*q" integer \*q

Default: off.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qDualRefresh\*q \*q" integer \*q
The 69030 supports independent refresh rates on its two display channels.
This mode of operations uses additional memory bandwidth and thus limits
the maximum colour depth and refresh rate that can be achieved, and so is
off by default.  Using this option forces the use of an independent refresh
rate on the two screens.
Default: off.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

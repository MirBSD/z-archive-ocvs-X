.SH NAME
r128 \- ATI Rage 128 video driver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B "Section \*qDevice\*q"
.BI "  Identifier \*q"  devname \*q
.B  "  Driver \*qr128\*q"
\ \ ...
.B EndSection
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B r128
is an XFree86 driver for ATI Rage 128 based video cards.  It contains
full support for 8, 15, 16 and 24 bit pixel depths, hardware
acceleration of drawing primitives, hardware cursor, video modes up to
1800x1440 @@ 70Hz, doublescan modes (e.g., 320x200 and 320x240), gamma
correction at all pixel depths, a fully programming dot clock and robust
text mode restoration for VT switching.
.SH SUPPORTED HARDWARE
The
.B r128
driver supports all ATI Rage 128 based video cards including the Rage
Fury AGP 32MB, the XPERT 128 AGP 16MB and the XPERT 99 AGP 8MB.
.SH CONFIGURATION DETAILS
Please refer to XF86Config(__filemansuffix__) for general configuration
details.  This section only covers configuration details specific to this
driver.
.PP
The driver auto-detects all device information necessary to initialize
the card.  However, if you have problems with auto-detection, you can
specify:
.PP
.RS 4
VideoRam - in kilobytes
.br
MemBase  - physical address of the linear framebuffer
.br
IOBase   - physical address of the MMIO registers
.br
ChipID   - PCI DEVICE ID
.RE
.PP
In addition, the following driver
.B Options
are supported:
.TP
.BI "Option \*qSWcursor\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Selects software cursor.  The default is
.B off.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qNoAccel\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enables or disables all hardware acceleration.  The default is to
.B enable
hardware acceleration.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qDac6Bit\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enables or disables the use of 6 bits per color component when in 8 bpp
mode (emulates VGA mode).  By default, all 8 bits per color component
are used.  The default is
.B off.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qVideoKey\*q \*q" integer \*q
This overrides the default pixel value for the YUV video overlay key.
The default value is
.B undefined.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qDisplay\*q \*q" string \*q
Select display mode for devices which support flat panels. Supported modes are:

.B \*qFP\*q
- use flat panel;

.B \*qCRT\*q
- use cathode ray tube;

.B \*qMirror\*q
- use both FP and CRT;

.B \*qBIOS\*q
- use mode as configured in the BIOS.

The default is
.B FP.

.PP
The following
.B Options
are mostly important for non-x86 architectures:
.TP
.BI "Option \*qProgramFPRegs\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enable or disable programming of the flat panel registers.
Beware that this may damage your panel, so use this
.B at your own risk.
The default depends on the device.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qPanelWidth\*q \*q" integer \*q
.TP
.BI "Option \*qPanelHeight\*q \*q" integer \*q
Override the flat panel dimensions in pixels. They are used to program the flat panel
registers and normally determined using the video card BIOS. If the wrong dimensions
are used, the system may hang.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qUseFBDev\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enable or disable use of an OS-specific framebuffer device interface
(which is not supported on all OSs).  See fbdevhw(__drivermansuffix__)
for further information.
Default: off.

.PP
The following additional
.B Options
are supported:
.TP
.BI "Option \*qShowCache\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enable or disable viewing offscreen cache memory.  A
development debug option.  Default: off.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

Default: off.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qDMAForXv\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Try or don't try to use DMA for Xv image transfers. This will reduce CPU
usage when playing big videos like DVDs, but may cause instabilities.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

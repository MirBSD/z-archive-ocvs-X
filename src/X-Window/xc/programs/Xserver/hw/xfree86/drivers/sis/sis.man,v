.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sis 
is an XFree86 driver for SiS video cards. The driver is accelerated, and
provides support for 8, 16 and 24 colordepths. XVideo, Render and other
extensions are supported as well.
.SH SUPPORTED HARDWARE
The
.B sis
driver supports PCI and AGP video cards based on the following chipsets:
.PP
.B SIS5597
.B SIS5598
.B SIS530
.B SIS6326
.B SIS300
.B SIS540
.B SIS630
.SH CONFIGURATION DETAILS
Please refer to XF86Config(__filemansuffix__) for general configuration
details.  This section only covers configuration details specific to this
driver.
.PP
The driver will auto-detect the amount of video memory present for all
chips, but in the 6326 case, it will limit the memory size to 4MB. This
is because of a bug (in docs at least). You can override this using the
.B \*qVideoRAM\*q
option in the device section if your board has more than
4MB and you need to use it (maybe with cursor problems).
.PP
If you have problems getting high resolutions because of dot clock
limitations, try using the
.B \*qDacSpeed\*q
option, also in the device section.
.PP
The following driver
.B Options
are supported:
.TP
.BI "Option \*qNoAccel\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Disable or enable acceleration. Default: acceleration is enabled.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qHWCursor\*q \*q" boolean \*q

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

.PP
.I "2. Old series specific information"
.PP
The driver will auto-detect the amount of video memory present for all
these chips, but in the case of the 6326, it will limit the memory size
to 4MB. This is because the 6326's 2D engine can only address 4MB. The
remaining memory seems to be intended for 3D texture data, since only
the 3D engine can address RAM above 4MB. However, you can override this
limitation using the
.B \*qVideoRAM\*q
option in the Device section if your board has more than 4MB and you
need to use it. However, 2D acceleration, Xvideo and the HWCursor will
be disabled in this case.
.PP
The driver will also auto-detect the maximum dotclock and DAC speed.
If you have problems getting high resolutions because of dot clock
limitations, try using the
.B \*qDacSpeed\*q
option, also in the Device section. However, this is not recommended
for the 6326. For this chip, the driver has two built-in modes for
high resolutions which you should use instead. These are named
.B \*qSIS1280x1024-75\*q
and
.B \*qSIS1600x1200-60\*q
and they will be added to the list of default modes. To use these modes,
just place them in your Screen section. Example:
.PP
.BI "Modes \*qSIS1600x1200-60\*q \*qSIS1280x1024x75\*q \*q1024x768\*q ...
.PP
Of these modes, 1280x1024 is only available at 8, 15 and 16bpp. 1600x1200
is available at 8bpp only.
.PP
TV support for the 6326
.PP
TV output is supported for the 6326. The driver will auto detect a
TV connected and in this case add the following modes to the list
of default modes: "PAL800x600", "PAL800x600U", "PAL720x540",
"PAL640x480", "NTSC640x480", "NTSC640x480U" and "NTSC640x400".
Use these modes like the hi-res modes described above.
.PP
The following driver
.B Options
are supported on the old series:
.TP
.BI "Option \*qTurboQueue\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enable or disable TurboQueue mode.  Default: off for SIS530/620, on for
the others
.TP
.BI "Option \*qFastVram\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enable or disable FastVram mode.  Enabling this sets the video RAM timing
to one cycle per read operation instead of two cycles. Disabling this will
set two cycles for read and write operations. Leaving this option out uses
the default, which varies depending on the chipset.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qNoHostBus\*q \*q" boolean \*q
(SiS5597/5598 only). Disable CPU-to-VGA host bus support. This
speeds up CPU to video RAM transfers. Default: Host bus is enabled.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qNoXVideo\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Disable XV (XVideo) extension support. Default: XVideo is on.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qNoYV12\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Disable YV12 Xv support. This might me required due to hardware bugs in some
chipsets. Disabling YV12 support forces Xv-aware applications to use YUV2 or
XShm for video output.
Default: YV12 support is on.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qTVStandard\*q \*q" string \*q
(6326 only) Valid parameters are
.B PAL
or
.B NTSC.
The default is set by a jumper on the card.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qTVXPosOffset\*q \*q" integer \*q
(6326 only) This option allows tuning the horizontal position of the image
for TV output. The range is from -16 to 16. Default: 0
.TP
.BI "Option \*qTVYPosOffset\*q \*q" integer \*q
(6326 only) This option allows tuning the vertical position of the image
for TV output. The range is from -16 to 16. Default: 0
.TP
.BI "Option \*qSIS6326TVEnableYFilter\*q \*q" boolean \*q
(6326 only) This option allows enabling/disabling the Y (chroma) filter for
TV output.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qSIS6326TVAntiFlicker\*q \*q" string \*q
(6326 only) This option allow enabling/disabling the anti flicker facility
for TV output. Possible parameters are
.B OFF, LOW, MED, HIGH
or
.B ADAPTIVE.
By experience,
.B ADAPTIVE
yields the best results, hence it is the default.
.PP
.I "2. 300 and 315/330 series specific information"
.PP
The 300 and 315/330 series feature two CRT controllers and very often come
with a video bridge for controlling LCD and TV output. Hereinafter, the
term
.B CRT1
refers to the VGA output of the chip, and
.B CRT2
refers to either LCD, TV or secondary VGA. Due to timing reasons,
only one CRT2 output can be active at the same time. But this
limitation does not apply to using CRT1 and CRT2 at the same time
which makes it possible to run the driver in dual head mode.
.PP
The driver supports the following video bridges:
.PP
.B SiS301
.B SiS301B(-DH)
.B SiS301C
.B SiS301LV(X)
.B SiS302LV
.PP
Instead of a video bridge, some machines have a
.B LVDS
transmitter to control LCD panels, and a
.B "Chrontel 7005"
or
.B "7019"
for TV output. All these are supported as well.
.PP
About TV output
.PP
On the SiS301 and the Chrontel 7005, only resolutions up to 800x600
are supported. On all others, resolutions up to 1024x768 are supported.
However, due to a hardware bug, Xvideo might be distorted on SiS video
bridges if running NTSC or PAL-M at 1024x768.
.PP
About XVideo support
.PP
XVideo is supported on all chipsets of both families. However, there
are some differences in hardware features which cause limitations.
The 300 series as well as the SiS55x, M650, 651, 661FX, M661FX, and
741 support two video overlays. The SiS315/H/PRO, 650/740 and 330 support
only one such overlay. On chips with two overlays, one overlay is used
for CRT1, the other for CRT2. On the other chipsets, the option
.B \*qXvOnCRT2\*q
can be used to select the desired output channel.
.PP
About Merged Framebuffer support
.PP
This mode is strongly recommended over Xinerama. Please see
http://www.winischhofer.net/linuxsisvga.shtml for detailed
information.
.PP
About dual-head support
.PP
Dual head mode has some limitations as regards color depth and
resolution. Due to memory bandwidth limits, CRT1 might have a
reduced maximum refresh rate if running on higher resolutions than
1280x1024.
.PP
Colordepth 8 is not supported when running in dual head mode.
.PP
The following driver
.B Options
are supported on the 300 and 315/330 series:
d95 1
a95 2
Disable XV (XVideo) extension support.
Default: XVideo is on.
d97 3
a99 126
.BI "Option \*qXvOnCRT2\*q \*q" boolean \*q
On chipsets with only one video overlay, this option can
used to bind the overlay to CRT1 ( if a monitor is detected
and if this option is either unset or set to
.B false
) or CRT2 ( if a CRT2 device is detected or forced, and if this
option is set to
.B true
). If either only CRT1 or CRT2 is detected, the driver decides
automatically. In Merged Framebuffer mode, this option is ignored.
Default: overlay is used on CRT1
.TP
.BI "Option \*qForceCRT1\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Force CRT1 to be on of off. If a monitor is connected, it will be
detected during server start. However, some old monitors are not
detected correctly. In such cases, you may set this option to
.B on
in order to make the driver initialize CRT1 anyway.
If this option is set to
.B off
, the driver will switch off CRT1.
Default: auto-detect
.TP
.BI "Option \*qForceCRT2Type\*q \*q" string \*q
Force display type to one of:
.B NONE
,
.B TV
,
.B SVIDEO
,
.B COMPOSITE
,
.B SVIDEO+COMPOSITE
,
.B SCART
,
.B LCD
,
.B VGA
;
.B NONE
will disable CRT2. The SVIDEO, COMPOSITE, SVIDEO+COMPOSITE and SCART
parameters are for SiS video bridges only and can be used to force the
driver to use a specific TV output connector (if present).
Default: auto detect.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qCRT2Gamma\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enable or disable gamma correction for CRT2. Only supported
for SiS video bridges. Default: Gamma correction for CRT2 is on.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qTVStandard\*q \*q" string \*q
Force the TV standard to either
.B PAL
or
.B NTSC.
On some machines with 630, 730 and the 315/330 series,
.B PALM
,
.B PALN
and
.B NTSCJ
are supported as well. Default: BIOS setting.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qTVXPosOffset\*q \*q" integer \*q
This option allows tuning the horizontal position of the image for
TV output. The range is from -32 to 32. Not supported on the Chrontel
7019. Default: 0
.TP
.BI "Option \*qTVYPosOffset\*q \*q" integer \*q
This option allows tuning the vertical position of the image for TV
output. The range is from -32 to 32. Not supported on the Chrontel
7019. Default: 0
.TP
.BI "Option \*qSISTVXScale\*q \*q" integer \*q
This option selects the horizontal zooming level for TV output. The range
is from -16 to 16. Only supported on SiS video bridges. Default: 0
.TP
.BI "Option \*qSISTVYScale\*q \*q" integer \*q
This option selects the vertical zooming level for TV output in the
following modes: 640x480, 800x600. On the 315/330 series, also 720x480,
720x576 and 768x576. The range is from -4 to 3. Only supported on
SiS video bridges. Default: 0
.TP
.BI "Option \*qCHTVOverscan\*q \*q" boolean \*q
On machines with a Chrontel TV encoder, this can be used to force the
TV mode to overscan or underscan.
.B on
means overscan,
.B off
means underscan.
Default: BIOS setting.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qCHTVSuperOverscan\*q \*q" boolean \*q
On machines with a Chrontel 7005 TV encoder, this option
enables a super-overscan mode. This is only supported if
the TV standard is PAL. Super overscan will produce an
image on the TV which is larger than the viewable area.
.PP
The driver supports many more options. Please see
http://www.winischhofer.net/linuxsisvga.shtml for
more information.
.PP
.I "3. 300 series specific information"
.PP
DRI is supported on the 300 series only. On Linux, DRI requires the
kernel's SiS framebuffer driver (
.B sisfb
) and some other modules which come with either the kernel or XFree86.
.PP
Sisfb takes care of memory management for texture data. In order to
prevent the X Server and sisfb from overwriting each other's data,
sisfb reserves an amount of video memory for the X driver. This amount
can either be selected using sisfb's mem parameter, or auto-selected
depending on the amount of total video RAM available.
.PP
Sisfb can be used for memory management only, or as a complete framebuffer
driver. If you start sisfb with a valid mode (ie you gain a graphical console),
the X driver can communicate with sisfb and doesn't require any
manual configuration for finding out about the video memory it is allowed
to use.
However, if you are running a 2.4 series Linux kernel and use sisfb for
video memory management only, ie you started sisfb with mode=none and still
have a text mode console, there is no communication between sisfb and the
X driver. For this purpose,
the
d102 4
a105 24
.PP
exists. This option must be set to the same value as given to sisfb through
its "mem" parameter, ie the amount of memory to use for X in kilobytes.
.PP
If you started sisfb without the mem argument, sisfb will reserve
.TP
12288KB if more than 16MB of total video RAM is available,
.TP
8192KB if between 12 and 16MB of video RAM is available,
.TP
4096KB in all other cases.
.PP
If you intend to use DRI, I recommend setting the total video memory in
the BIOS to 64MB in order to at least overcome the lack of memory swap
functions.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qDRI\*q \*q" boolean \*q
This option allows enabling or disabling DRI. By default, DRI is on.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qAGPSize\*q \*q" integer \*q
This option allows selecting the amount of AGP memory to be used for DRI.
The amount is to be specified in megabyte, the default is 8.
.SH "KNOWN BUGS"
none.

.I "2. Old series specific information"
.PP
The driver will auto-detect the amount of video memory present for all
these chips, but in the 6326 case, it will limit the memory size to 4MB.
This is because the 6326's 2D engine can only address 4MB. The remaining
memory seems to be intended for 3D texture data, since only the 3D
engine can address RAM above 4MB. However, you can override this forced
limitation using the
.B \*qVideoRAM\*q
option in the device section if your board has more than
4MB and you need to use it. However, 2D acceleration, Xvideo and the
HWCursor will be disabled in this case.
.PP
The driver will also auto-detect the maximum dotclock and DAC speed.
If you have problems getting high resolutions because of dot clock
limitations, try using the
.B \*qDacSpeed\*q
option, also in the device section. However, this is not recommended
for the 6326. For this chipset, the driver has two built-in modes for
high resolutions which you should use instead. These are named
.B \*qSIS1280x1024-75\*q
and
.B \*qSIS1600x1200-60\*q
and they will be added to the list of default modes. To use these modes,
just place them in your Screen section. Example:
.PP
.BI "Modes \*qSIS1600x1200-60\*q \*qSIS1280x1024x75\*q \*q1024x768\*q ...
.PP
1280x1024 is only available at 8, 15 and 16bpp. 1600x1200 is available
at 8bpp only.
.PP
TV support for the 6326
.PP
TV output is supported on the 6326. The driver will auto detect a
TV connected, and in this case add the following modes to the list
of default modes: "PAL800x600", "PAL800x600U", "PAL720x540",
"PAL640x480", "NTSC640x480", "NTSC640x480U" and "NTSC640x400".
Use these modes like the hi-res modes described above.
.PP
The following driver
.B Options
are supported on the old series:

.BI "Option \*qTurboQueue\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enable or disable TurboQueue mode.  Default: off for SIS530/620, on for
the others
.TP
.BI "Option \*qFastVram\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enable or disable FastVram mode.  Enabling this sets the video RAM timing 
to only one cycle per read operation instead of two cycles. Disabling
this will set 2 cycles for read and write operations. Leaving this
option out uses the default.
Default: off for read, on for write.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qNoHostBus\*q \*q" boolean \*q

.PP
.I "2. 300 and 310/325/330 series specific information"
.PP
The 300 and 310/325/330 series very often come with a video bridge for
controlling LCD and TV output. Hereinafter, the term
.B CRT1
refers to the VGA output of the chip, and
.B CRT2
refers to either LCD, TV or secondary VGA. Due to timing reasons,
only one CRT2 output can be active at the same time. But this
limitation does not apply to using CRT1 and CRT2 at the same time
which makes it possible to run the driver in dual head mode.
.PP
The driver supports the following video bridges:
.PP
.B SiS301
.B SiS301B
.B SiS301LV
.B SiS302B
.B SiS302LV
.PP
Instead of a video bridge, some machines have a
.B LVDS
transmitter to control LCD panels, and a
.B "Chrontel 7005"
or
.B "7019"
for TV output. All these are supported as well.
.PP
About TV output
.PP
On the SiS301 and the Chrontel 7005, only resolutions up to 800x600
are supported. On all others, resolutions up to 1024x768 are supported.
.PP
About XVideo support
.PP
XVideo is supported on all chipsets of both families. However, there
are some differences in hardware features which cause limitations.
The 300 series as well as the SiS550, 650M, 651 and 330 support two video
overlays. The SiS315/H/PRO and 650/740 support only one such overlay.
On chips with two overlays, one overlay is used for CRT1, the other
for CRT2. On the other chipsets, the option
.B \*qXvOnCRT2\*q
can be used to select the desired output channel.
.PP
About dual-head support
.PP
Dual head mode has some limitations as regards color depth and
resolution. Due to memory bandwidth limits, CRT1 might have a
reduced refresh rate if running on higher resolutions than
1280x1024.
.PP
Colordepth 8 is not supported when running in dual head mode.
.PP
The following driver
.B Options
are supported on the 300 and 310/325 series:
.TP
.BI "Option \*qNoXVideo\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Disable XV (XVideo) extension support.
Default: XVideo is on.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qXvOnCRT2\*q \*q" boolean \*q
On chipsets with only one video overlay, this option can
used to bind the overlay to CRT1 ( if a monitor is detected
and if this option is either unset or set to
.B false
) or CRT2 ( if a CRT2 device is detected or forced, and if this
option is set to
.B true
). If either only CRT1 or CRT2 is detected, the driver decides
automatically.
Default: overlay is used on CRT1
.TP
.BI "Option \*qForceCRT1\*q \*q" boolean \*q
The BIOS detects VGA monitors connected to CRT1 at boot time
and the X driver by default relies on the information passed
by the BIOS. However, some old monitors are not detected
correctly. If this is the case, or if you connected the VGA
monitor after you booted the machine, you may set this
option to
.B true
in order to make the X driver ignore the
information from the BIOS and initialize CRT1 anyway.
If this option is set to
.B false
, the driver will switch
off CRT1 and thus save memory bandwidth.
Default: auto detect CRT1
.TP
.BI "Option \*qForceCRT2Type\*q \*q" string \*q
Force display type to one of:
.B NONE
,
.B TV
,
.B SVIDEO
,
.B COMPOSITE
,
.B SCART,
,
.B LCD
,
.B VGA
;
.B NONE
will disable CRT2. The SVIDEO, COMPOSITE and SCART parameters
can be used to force the driver to use a specific TV output
connector (if present).
Default: auto detect.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qPanelDelayCompensation\*q \*q" integer \*q
This option is only for machines with a 300 series chipset
and either a SiS301B video bridge or a LVDS transmitter.
Different LCD panels require different delay compensation
values. In most cases, the driver can autodetect this value.
However, due to bad BIOS design this might fail in rare
cases. If your LCD shows small horizontal waves, set the
parameter of this option first to
.B 4
,
.B 32
or
.B 24
and if the problem persists, try using other values between
4 and 60 in steps of 4.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qUseROMData\*q \*q" boolean \*q
The driver reads some data from the BIOS ROM, especially
LCD dependent information. If the folks at SiS some day
decide to change the location of this data inside the
BIOS image, the display might not be initialized correctly.
In order to prevent this, set this option's parameter to
.B false.
Default: ROM data is used
.TP
.BI "Option \*qTVStandard\*q \*q" string \*q
Force the TV standard to either
.B PAL
or
.B NTSC.
On some machines with 630, 730 or 650/740,
.B PALM
and
.B PALN
are supported as well. Default: BIOS setting.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qTVXPosOffset\*q \*q" integer \*q
This option allows horizontal relocation the TV output.
The range is from -32 to 32. Not supported on the Chrontel
7019 yet.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qTVYPosOffset\*q \*q" integer \*q
This option allows vertical relocation the TV output.
The range is from -32 to 32. Not supported on the Chrontel
7019 yet.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qCHTVOverscan\*q \*q" boolean \*q
On machines with a Chrontel TV encoder, this can be used to
force the TV mode to overscan or underscan.
.B True
means overscan,
.B false
means underscan.
Default: BIOS setting.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qCHTVSuperOverscan\*q \*q" boolean \*q
On machines with a Chrontel 7005 TV encoder, this option
enables a super-overscan mode. This is only supported if
the TV standard is PAL. Super overscan will produce an
image on the TV which is larger than the viewable area.
.PP
.I "3. 300 series specific information"
.PP
DRI is supported on the 300 series only. DRI requires
the kernel's SiS framebuffer driver (
.B sisfb
) and some other modules
which come with either the kernel or XFree86.
.PP
Sisfb takes care of memory management for texture
data. In order to prevent the X driver and sisfb from
overwriting each others video memory, sisfb reserves
an amount of video memory for the X driver. This amount
can either be selected using sisfb's mem parameter, or
auto-selected depending on the amount of total video RAM
available. However, the X driver needs to know about the
amount of RAM sisfb reserved. For this purpose, the
d102 4
a105 44
.PP
exists.
.PP
At the moment (2002), the SiS DRI driver is not
maintained, lacks support for memory swapping and
has a few bugs. If you intend to use DRI, I recommend
setting the total video memory in the BIOS to 64MB
in order to at least overcome the lack of memory
swap functions.
.PP
Sisfb can be used for memory management only, or as
a complete framebuffer driver. If you start sisfb
with a valid mode (ie you gain a graphical console),
the X driver can communicate with sisfb and doesn't
require setting the
.B \*qMaxXFBMem\*q
option at all. The X driver will receive enough information
from sisfb in this case.
.PP
However, if you use sisfb for memory management only, ie
you started sisfb with mode=none and still have a text
mode console, there is no communication between sisfb
and the X driver. In this case, you need to set
.B \*qMaxXFBMem\*q
to the same value as you gave sisfb with its mem
parameter. If you didn't specify any mem parameter,
sisfb will reserve
.TP
12288KB if more than 16MB of total video RAM is available,
.TP
8192KB if between 12 and 16MB of video RAM is available,
.TP
4096KB in all other cases.
.PP
Then you need to specify any of these amounts as the
parameter for the
.B \*qMaxXFBMem\*q
option. The value is to be given without 'KB'.
.SH "KNOWN BUGS"
For some reason, PAL TV output on the SiS301LV bridge is
only black and white. NTSC is OK, though.
.PP
LCD panels with a resolution of 1280x1024 do not work
correctly.

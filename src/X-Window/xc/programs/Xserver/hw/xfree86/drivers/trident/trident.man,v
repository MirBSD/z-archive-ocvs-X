.SH DESCRIPTION
.B trident
is an XFree86 driver for Trident video cards.  The driver is 
accelerated, and provides support for the following framebuffer depths:
1, 4, 8, 15, 16, and 24. Multi-head configurations are supported.
The XvImage extension is supported on TGUI96xx and greater cards.
.SH SUPPORTED HARDWARE
The
.B trident
driver supports PCI,AGP and ISA video cards based on the following 
Trident chips:
.TP 12
.B Blade
Blade3D, CyberBlade series i1, i7 (DSTN), i1, i1 (DSTN), Ai1, Ai1 (DSTN),
CyberBlade/e4, CyberBladeXPm8, CyberBladeXPm16, CyberBladeAi1/XP, BladeXP
NOTE: The XP series are NOT hardware accelerated due to the specifications
of the chip not being released.

.B ISA/VLBus
8900C, 8900D, 9000, 9200CXr, Cyber9320, 9400CXi, 9440AGi
These cards have been ported but need furthur testing and may not work.
.SH CONFIGURATION DETAILS
Please refer to XF86Config(__filemansuffix__) for general configuration
details.  This section only covers configuration details specific to this
driver.
.PP
The following driver
.B Options
are supported:
.TP
.BI "Option \*qSWCursor\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enable or disable the SW cursor.  Default: off.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qNoAccel\*q \*q" boolean \*q

.BI "Option \*qPciRetry\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enable or disable PCI retries.  Default: off.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qCyberShadow\*q \*q" boolean \*q
For Cyber chipsets only, turn off shadow registers. If you only see
a partial display - this may be the option for you. Default: on.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qCyberStretch\*q \*q" boolean \*q
For Cyber chipsets only, turn on stretching. When the resolution is lower
than the LCD's screen, this option will stretch the graphics mode to
fill the entire LCD. Default: off.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qShadowFB\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enable or disable use of the shadow framebuffer layer.  Default: off.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qVideoKey\*q \*q" integer \*q
This sets the default pixel value for the YUV video overlay key.
Default: undefined.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qNoPciBurst\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Turn off PCI burst mode, PCI Bursting is on by default.
Default: off.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qXvHsync\*q \*q" integer \*q
Override the default Horizontal-sync value for the Xv extension.
This is used to center the Xv image on the screen.  By default the values
are assigned based on the video card.
Default: 0.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qXvVsync\*q \*q" integer \*q
Override the default Vertical-sync value for the Xv extension.
This is used to center the Xv image on the screen.  By default the values
are assigned based on the video card.
Default: 0.
.BI "Option \*qXvBskew\*q \*q" integer \*q
Override the default Bottom skew value for the Xv extension.
This is used to extend the Xv image on the screen at the bottom.  By 
default the values are assigned based on the video card.
Default: 0.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qXvRskew\*q \*q" integer \*q
Override the default Right skew value for the Xv extension.
This is used to extend the Xv image on the screen at the right.  By 
default the values are assigned based on the video card.
Default: 0.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

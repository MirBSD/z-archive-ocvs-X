.SH NAME
neomagic \- Neomagic video driver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf

.BI "  Identifier \*q"  devname \*q
.B  "  Driver \*qneomagic\*q"
\ \ ...
.B EndSection
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B neomagic 
is an XFree86 driver for the Neomagic graphics chipsets found in many
laptop computers.  
.SH SUPPORTED HARDWARE
.B neomagic
supports the following chipsets:
.PP
.TP 
MagicGraph 128    (NM2070)
.TP
MagicGraph 128V   (NM2090)
.TP 
MagicGraph 128ZV  (NM2093)
.TP 
MagicGraph 128ZV+ (NM2097)
.TP 
MagicGraph 128XD  (NM2160)
.TP 
MagicGraph 256AV  (NM2200)
.TP 
MagicGraph 256AV+ (NM2230)
.TP 
MagicGraph 256ZX  (NM2360)
.TP 
MagicGraph 256XL+ (NM2380)
.PP
The driver supports depths 8, 15, 16 and 24 for all chipsets except the
NM2070 which does not support depth 24.  All depths are accelerated except for
depth 24 which is only accelerated on NM2200
and newer models.  All visuals are supported in depth 8.  TrueColor and
DirectColor visuals are supported in the other depths.

.SH CONFIGURATION DETAILS
Please refer to XF86Config(__filemansuffix__) for general configuration
details.  This section only covers configuration details specific to this
driver.
.PP
The following driver
.B Options
are supported
.TP
.BI "Option \*qNoAccel\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Disable or enable acceleration.  Default: acceleration is enabled.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qSWCursor\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Disable or enable software cursor.  Default: software cursor is disable
and a hardware cursor is used.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qPCIBurst\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Disable or enable PCI burst modes.  Default: enabled.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qRotate\*q \*qCW\*q"

.PP
.B Note
.br
On some laptops using the 2160 chipset (MagicGraph 128XD) the
following options are needed to avoid a lock-up of the graphic engine:
.nf
    Option "XaaNoScanlineImageWriteRect"
    Option "XaaNoScanlineCPUToScreenColorExpandFill"
.fi

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

Reserve the given amount of memory (in bytes) for the XVideo overlay.  On
boards with limited memory, display of large XVideo buffers might fail due
to insufficient available memory.  Using this option solves the problem at
the expense of reducing the memory available for other operations.  For
full\-resolution DVDs, 829440 bytes (720x576x2) are necessary.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

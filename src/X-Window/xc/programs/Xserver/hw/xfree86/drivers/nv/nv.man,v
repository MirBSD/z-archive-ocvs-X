.SH DESCRIPTION
.B nv 
is an XFree86 driver for NVIDIA video cards.  The driver is fully
accelerated and provides support for the following framebuffer depths:
8, 15, 16 (except Riva128) and 24.  All
visual types are supported for depth 8, TrueColor and DirectColor
visuals are supported for the other depths with the exception of
the Riva128 which only supports TrueColor in the higher depths.  Multi-head configurations
are supported.
.SH SUPPORTED HARDWARE
The
.B nv
driver supports PCI and AGP video cards based on the following NVIDIA chips:
.TP 22
.B RIVA 128
NV3
.TP 22
.B RIVA TNT
NV4

.SH CONFIGURATION DETAILS
Please refer to XF86Config(__filemansuffix__) for general configuration
details.  This section only covers configuration details specific to this
driver.
.PP
The driver auto-detects the chipset type and the amount of video memory
present for all chips.

.BI "Option \*qHWCursor\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enable or disable the HW cursor.  Default: on.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qNoAccel\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Disable or enable acceleration.  Default: acceleration is enabled.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qUseFBDev\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enable or disable use of on OS-specific fb interface (and is not supported
on all OSs).  See fbdevhw(__drivermansuffix__) for further information.
Default: off.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qRotate\*q \*qCW\*q"
.TP
.BI "Option \*qRotate\*q \*qCCW\*q"
Rotate the display clockwise or counterclockwise.  This mode is unaccelerated.
Default: no rotation.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

.BI "Option \*qCrtcNumber\*q \*q" integer \*q
GeForce2 MX, nForce2, Quadro4, GeForce4, Quadro FX and GeForce FX 
may have two video outputs.  
The driver attempts to autodetect
which one the monitor is connected to.  In the case that autodetection picks
the wrong one, this option may be used to force usage of a particular output. 
The options are "0" or "1".
Default: autodetected.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qFlatPanel\*q \*q" boolean \*q
The driver usually can autodetect the presence of a digital flat panel.  In
the case that this fails, this option can be used to force the driver to 
treat the attached device as a digital flat panel.  With this 
driver, a digital flat panel will only work if it was POSTed by the BIOS, 
that is, the
machine must have booted to the panel.  If you have a dual head card
you may also need to set the option CrtcNumber described above.
Default: off.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qFPDither\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Many digital flat panels (particularly ones on laptops) have only 6 bits 
per component color resolution.
This option tells the driver to dither from 8 bits per component to 6 before
the flat panel truncates it. This is only supported in depth 24 on GeForce2 MX, 
nForce2, GeForce4, Quadro4, Geforce FX and Quadro FX.
Default: off.

Note: The Resize and Rotate extension will be disabled if the Rotate option
is used.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

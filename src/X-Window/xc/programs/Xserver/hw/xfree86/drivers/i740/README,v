@		      Information for i740 Users
		      i740 Driver Version 3.0


1. Supported Hardware

   * Intel 740 based cards


2. Features

   * Full support for 8, 15, 16, 24 and 32 bit per pixel depths.
   * Hardware cursor support to reduce sprite flicker.
   * Hardware accelerated 2D drawing engine support for 8, 15, 16 and
     24 bit per pixel depths.
   * Support for high resolution video modes up to 1600x1200.
   * Support for doublescan video modes (e.g., 320x200 and 320x240).
   * Support for gamma correction at all pixel depths.
   * Fully programmable clock supported.
   * Robust text mode restore for VT switching.


3. Technical Notes

   * Hardware acceleration is not possible in 32 bit per pixel depth.
   * Interlace modes cannot be supported.

5. Configuration

   The driver auto-detects all device information necessary to
   initialize the card.  The only lines you need in the "Device"
   section of your XF86Config file are:

       Section "Device"
           Identifier "Intel i740"
	   Driver     "i740"
       EndSection

   or let xf86config or XF86Setup do this for you.

   However, if you have problems with auto-detection, you can specify:

       VideoRam - in kilobytes
       DacSpeed - in MHz
       MemBase  - physical address of the linear framebuffer
       IOBase   - physical address of the memory mapped IO registers


6. Driver Options

   The server automatically detects its configuration, so none of
   these options should be required.

   "NoAccel"  - Turn off hardware acceleration
   "SWCursor" - Request a software cursor (hardware is default)
   "SDRAM"    - Force the use of SDRAM timings
   "SGRAM"    - Force the use of SGRAM timings
   "SlowRam"  - Force the use of slower ram timings
   "Dac6Bit"  - Force the use of a 6 Bit Dac (8 Bit is the default)
   "UsePIO    - Force the use of programmed IO (Memory mapped is the default)

7. Known Limitations

   * Certain drawing operations are very slow when using 24 bit per
     pixel depth mode.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

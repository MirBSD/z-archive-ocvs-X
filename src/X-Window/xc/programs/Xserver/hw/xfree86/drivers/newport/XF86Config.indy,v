# Uncomment this to cause a core dump at the spot where a signal is 
# received.  This may leave the console in an unusable state, but may
# provide a better stack trace in the core dump to aid in debugging

#    Option	"NoTrapSignals"

# Uncomment this to disable the <Crtl><Alt><BS> server abort sequence
# This allows clients to receive this key event.

#    Option	"DontZap"

# Uncomment this to disable the <Crtl><Alt><KP_+>/<KP_-> mode switching
# sequences.  This allows clients to receive these key events.

#    Option	"DontZoom"

# Uncomment this to disable tuning with the xvidtune client. With
# it the client can still run and fetch card and monitor attributes,
# but it will not be allowed to change them. If it tries it will
# receive a protocol error.

#    Option	"DisableVidModeExtension"

# Uncomment this to enable the use of a non-local xvidtune client.

#    Option	"AllowNonLocalXvidtune"

# Uncomment this to disable dynamically modifying the input device
# (mouse and keyboard) settings.

#    Option	"DisableModInDev"

# Uncomment this to enable the use of a non-local client to
# change the keyboard or mouse settings (currently only xset).

#    Option	"AllowNonLocalModInDev"

# Set the basic blanking screen saver timeout.

    Option	"blank time"	"10"	# 10 minutes

# Set the DPMS timeouts.  These are set here because they are global
# rather than screen-specific.  These settings alone don't enable DPMS.
# It is enabled per-screen (or per-monitor), and even then only when
# the driver supports it.

    Option	"standby time"	"20"
    Option	"suspend time"	"30"
    Option	"off time"	"60"

# On some platform the server needs to estimate the sizes of PCI
# memory and pio ranges. This is done by assuming that PCI ranges
# don't overlap. Some broken BIOSes tend to set ranges of inactive
# devices wrong. Here one can adjust how aggressive the assumptions
# should be. Default is 0.

# For most OSs the protocol can be omitted (it defaults to "Standard").
# When using XQUEUE (only for SVR3 and SVR4, but not Solaris), comment
# out the above line, and uncomment the following line.

#    Option	"Protocol"	"Xqueue"

# Set the keyboard auto repeat parameters.  Not all platforms implement
# this.

    Option	"AutoRepeat"	"500 5"

# Specifiy which keyboard LEDs can be user-controlled (eg, with xset(1)).

#    Option	"Xleds"	"1 2 3"

# To disable the XKEYBOARD extension, uncomment XkbDisable.

#    Option	"XkbDisable"

# To customise the XKB settings to suit your keyboard, modify the
# lines below (which are the defaults).  For example, for a European
# keyboard, you will probably want to use one of:
#
#    Option	"XkbModel"	"pc102"
#    Option	"XkbModel"	"pc105"
#
# If you have a Microsoft Natural keyboard, you can use:
#
#    Option	"XkbModel"	"microsoft"
#
# If you have a US "windows" keyboard you will want:
#
#    Option	"XkbModel"	"pc104"
#
# Then to change the language, change the Layout setting.
# For example, a german layout can be obtained with:
#
#    Option	"XkbLayout"	"de"
#
# or:
#
#    Option	"XkbLayout"	"de"
#    Option	"XkbVariant"	"nodeadkeys"
#
# If you'd like to switch the positions of your capslock and
# control keys, use:

#    Option	"XkbOptions"	"ctrl:swapcaps"

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

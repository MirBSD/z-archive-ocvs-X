# tk_optionMenu --
# This procedure creates an option button named $w and an associated
# menu.  Together they provide the functionality of Motif option menus:
# they can be used to select one of many values, and the current value
# appears in the global variable varName, as well as in the text of
# the option menubutton.  The name of the menu is returned as the
# procedure's result, so that the caller can use it to change configuration
# options on the menu or otherwise manipulate it.
#
# Arguments:
# w -			The name to use for the menubutton.
# varName -		Global variable to hold the currently selected value.
# firstValue -		First of legal values for option (must be >= 1).
# args -		Any number of additional values.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-
# butor be held liable for any damage, directly or indirectly, that origina-

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

# checks the -takefocus option for the window and uses it if it's
# set.  If there's no -takefocus option, the procedure checks to
# see if (a) the widget isn't disabled, and (b) it has some key
# bindings.  If all of these are true, then 1 is returned.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

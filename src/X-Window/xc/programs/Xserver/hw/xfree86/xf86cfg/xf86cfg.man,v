.TH xf86cfg 1 __vendorversion__
.SH NAME
xf86cfg - Graphical configuration tool for XFree86 4.0
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xf86cfg
[-xf86config \fIXF86Config\fP] [-modulepath \fImoduledir\fP] 
[-fontpath \fIfontsdir\fP] [-toolkitoption ...]
.SH DESCRITPION
.I Xf86cfg
is a tool to configure \fIXFree86 4.0\fP, and can be used to either write the
initial configuration file or make customizations to the current configuration.
.PP
When the \fBDISPLAY\fP environment variable is not set, xf86cfg will run
the command \fIXFree86 -configure\fP to allow the xserver detect the
hardware in the computer, and write an initial \fIXF86Config\fP file
in the user's home directory. Then, it will start XFree86 and allow
customizations.
.br
If the \fBDISPLAY\fP environment variable is set, xf86cfg will read the
default \fIXF86Config\fP, that may not be the same being used by the current
server, and allow customizations.
.PP
To use an alternative location for modules or fonts the respective search
paths may be specified.
.PP
Unless there is an \fBApply\fP button in the current xf86cfg dialog, the
changes made will take place the next time \fIXFree86\fP is started.

.PP
Xf86cfg allows addition and configuration of new devices, such as video cards,
monitors, keyboards and mouses.
.PP
Screen layout configuration for xinerama or traditional multi-head is also
available.
.PP
Modelines can be configured or optimized.
.PP
AccessX basic configurations can be made in the xf86cfg's accessx section.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.I -xf86config
Specifies an alternate XF86Config file for configuration.
.TP 8
.I -modulepath
Specifies where xf86cfg, and the server it may start, should look for
XFree86 modules.
.TP 8
.I -serverpath
Specifies the complete path, not including the binary name, of the
XFree86 binary.
.TP 8
.I -fontpath
Specifies the path to the fonts that should be used by the server started
by xf86cfg.
.TP 8
.I -rgbpath
Specifies the path to the rgb.txt file that should be used by the server
started by xf86cfg, if any.
.TP 8
.I -textmode
If xf86cfg was compiled with support to ncurses, this option makes xf86cfg
enters a text mode interface.
.TP 8
.I -nomodules
When built with support for loading modules, this options changes xf86cfg
behaviour, so that it will not load any modules, and thus start quickier.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP 8
.I DISPLAY
Default host and display number
.TP 8
.I XWINHOME
Directory where XFree86 was installed, defaults to /usr/X11R6.
.TP 8

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

log
@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.SH NAME
pcitweak - read/write PCI config space
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pcitweak
.B \-l

.B pcitweak
.B \-r
.I PCI-ID
.RB [ \-b | \-h ]
.I offset

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pcitweak
is a utility that can be used to examine or change registers in the PCI
configuration space.  On most platfoms
.I pcitweak
can only be run by the root user.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.B \-l
Probe the PCI buses and print a line for each detected device.  Each line
contains the bus location (bus:device:function), chip vendor/device, card
(subsystem) vendor/card, revision, class and header type.  All values
printed are in hexadecimal.
.TP 8
.BI "\-r " PCI-ID
Read the PCI configuration space register at
.I offset
for the PCI device at bus location
.IR PCI-ID .
.I PCI-ID
should be given in the form bus:device:function, with each value in
hexadecimal.  By default, a 32-bit register is read.
.TP 8
.BI "\-w " PCI-ID
Write
.I value
to the PCI configuration space register at
.I offset
for the PCI device at bus location
.IR PCI-ID .
.I PCI-ID
should be given in the form bus:device:function, with each value in
hexadecimal.  By default, a 32-bit register is written.
.TP 8
.B \-b
Read or write an 8-bit value (byte).
.TP 8
.B \-h
Read or write a 16-bit value (halfword).

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@That's what OpenBSD will, probably, ship as XF4 in 3.5
their last sync against XFree86 4.3-current has been
imported into our vendor branch, too

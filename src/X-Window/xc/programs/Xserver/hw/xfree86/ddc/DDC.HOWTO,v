@			DDC.HOWTO

  This file describes how to add DDC support to a chipset driver.

1) DDC INITIALIZATION

   When implementing DDC in the driver one has the choice between
   DDC1 and DDC2. 
   DDC1 data is contiuously transmitted by a DDC1 capable display 
   device. The data is send serially over a data line; the Vsync 
   signal serves as clock. Only one EDID 1.x data block can be 
   transmitted using DDC1. Since transmission of an EDID1 block 
   using a regular Vsync frequency would take up several seconds 
   the driver can increase the Vsync frequency to up to 25 kHz as 
   soon as it detects DDC1 activety on the data line.
   DDC2 data is transmitted using the I2C protocol. This requires
   an additional clock line. DDC2 is capable of transmitting EDID1
   and EDID2 block as well as a VDIF block on display devices that 
   support these.  
   Display devices switch into the DDC2 mode as soon as they detect
   activety on the DDC clock line. Once the are in DDC2 mode they
   stop transmitting DDC1 signals until the next power cycle.

   Some graphics chipset configurations which are not capable of
   DDC2 might still be able to read DDC1 data. Where available
   DDC2 it is preferrable. 
	
   All relevant prototypes and defines are in xf86DDC.h.
   DDC2 additionally requires I2C support. The I2C prototypes
   are in xf86i2c.h.

   DDC1 Support:

     The driver has to provide a read function which waits for the
     end of the next Vsync signal and reads in and returns the status
     of the DDC line:

     unsigned int XXX_ddc1Read(ScrnInfoPtr pScrn)
     
     Additionally a function is required to inclrease the Vsync
     frequency to max. 25 kHz. 
 
     void XXX_ddc1SetSpeed(ScrnInfoPtr pScrn, xf86ddcSpeed speed)
 
     If the speed argument is DDC_FAST the function should increase
     the Vsync frequency on DDC_SLOW it should restore the original
     value. For convenience a generic ddc1SetSpeed() function is provided
     in the vga module for VGA-like chipsets.     
	
     void vgaHWddc1SetSpeed(ScrnInfoPtr pScrn, sf86ddcSpeed speed).

     To read out the DDC1 data the driver should call 

     xf86MonPtr xf86DoEDID_DDC1(int scrnIndex, 
                              void (*DDC1SetSpeed)(ScrnInfoPtr, xf86ddcSpeed),
                              unsigned int (*DDC1Read)(ScrnInfoPtr))
 
     in PreInit(). DDC1SetSpeed is a pointer to the SetSpeed()
     function, DDC1Read has to point to the DDC1 read function.
     The function will return a pointer to the xf86Monitor structure
     which contains all information retreived by DDC.
     NULL will be returned on failure.

   DDC2 Support
 
     To read out DDC2 information I2C has to be initialized first.
     (See documentation for the i2c module). 
     The function 
     
     xf86MonPtr xf86DoEDID_DDC2(int scrnIndex, I2CBusPtr pBus)

     is provided to read out and process DDC2 data. A pointer
     to the I2CBusRec of the appropriate I2C Bus has to be passed
     as the second argument.
     The function will return a pointer to the xf86Monitor structure
     which contains all information retreived by DDC.
     NULL will be returned on failure.

   Printing monitor parameters   

     To print out the information contained in the xf86Monitor
     structure the function 

     xf86MonPtr xf86PrintEDID(xf86MonPtr monitor)
 
     is provided.

    Further processing of the xf86Monitor structure is not yet 
    implemented. Howerver it is planned to use the information
    about video modes, gamma values etc.
    Therefore it is strongly recommended to read out DDC data
    before any video mode processing is done.

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

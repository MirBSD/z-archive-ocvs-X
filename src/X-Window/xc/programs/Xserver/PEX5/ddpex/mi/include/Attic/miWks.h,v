/**********************************************************************
 View numbers sparsely fill the range 0 - 65534 
 Since there is no way to predetermine which views will be defined,
 all views must be in the original priority list. The original
 list contains all views possible prioritized in numerical
 order, 0 is highest priority and 65534 is lowest.
 Each entry in the priority list contains a range of 
 views. All views in that range are prioritized numerically.
 When a view is defined, it is put in an entry by itself with
 first_view = last_view and defined = T.  Only defined views can
 have their priority changed, so putting them in their own entry
 makes this easier. If a view is deleted, its entry in the priority
 list has defined=F and stays in the list. If the view is set again, 
 defined is set to T again and it stays in the list whereever it is.

 The higher and lower fields contain the index of the entry containing
 the higher and lower priority views, resp. When view priorities
 are set, these values are changed. The highest priority view has
 higher = -1. The lowest priority view has lower = -1. Invalid
 entries are kept in a free list.
 NOTE: higher and lower contain index values into the view priority
 tables. These values do not correspond to view numbers.

 The max number of defined views is possible.  With defined views
 using one entry and all other views defined in ranges which at
 most will use one entry between and around every defined view,
 the max number of entries will be MAX_DEFINED_VIEWS *2 +1.
 Then, add 2 dummies entries as the head and tail of the list.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

# distribute, modify, merge, sublicence, give away or sell it as long as the
# authors are given due credit and the following notice is retained:

# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-
# butor be held liable for any damage, directly or indirectly, that origina-

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

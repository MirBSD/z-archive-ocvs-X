	fax/tiffpb.c -- DDXIE TIFF Packbits decode technique/element
  
	Packbits is output-type independent.  The compression algorithm
	just compresses a stream. The 'strip_size' parameter should be 
	how many bytes long the strip is...

	Coding assumption:  it is always valid to do val = *byteptr++;
	But any code which does this is responsible for making sure
	the next access will also be valid.  Otherwise, we should
	save state and return.

We can make things a little quicker (and avoid signed char compiler issues)
if we simply look for whether the high bit is on or off, and then compute
the result directly.  Thus, 

if code && 0x80 =>  -128 <= code < 0

    0x80 + foo = -128 + foo

    so length = 1 - code = 1 - (-128 + foo) = 129 - foo.

    note foo=0 is code for runlength 0 (fill)

The positive case is even easier.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

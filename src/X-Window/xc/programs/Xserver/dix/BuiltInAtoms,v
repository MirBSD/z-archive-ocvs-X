@File: .../x11/server/dix/BuiltInAtoms

This file is of a fixed format and is used to generate both the file
include/XAtom.h and dix/initatoms.c. Neither of those files should be
edited directly. Changing the atoms in this file, or even the order in
which they occur, is equivalent to forcing a new (minor) version number
on the server. Take care.

The format of the file is that each built in atom starts in column 1
with no text, other than spaces and tabs, on that line other than a
mandatory trailing "@@" at the end of the line. For each atom (Foo)
below the defines will be of the form
	#define XA_Foo <n>
and the string value of the atom will be "Foo".

The comment lines in this file are not guaranteed to be accurate. To see the
current truth, look at the Xlib documentation as well as the protocol spec.

Atoms occur in five distinct name spaces within the protocol. Any particular
atom may or may not have some client interpretation within each of the name
spaces. For each of the built in atoms, the intended semantics and the space
within which it is defined is indicated.

Those name spaces are
	Property names
	Property types
	Selections
	Font properties
	Type of a ClientMessage event	(none built into server)

For the font properties mentioned here, see the spec for more information.

	Property type:

		green-max:	CARD32
		green-mult:	CARD32
		blue-max:	CARD32
		blue-mult:	CARD32
		base-pixel:	CARD32

	The fields `red_max', `green_max', and `blue_max' give the maximum
	red, green, and blue values, respectively.  Each color
	coefficient ranges from 0 to its max, inclusive.  For example,
	a common colormap allocation is 3/3/2:  3 planes for red, 3
	planes for green, and 2 planes for blue.  Such a colormap would
	have red_max == 7, green_max = 7, and blue_max = 3.  An alternate
	allocation that uses only 216 colors is red_max = 5, green_max =
	5, and blue_max = 5.

	The fields `red_mult', `green_mult', and `blue_mult' give the
	scale factors used to compose a full pixel value.  (See next
	paragraph.)  For a 3/3/2 allocation red_mult might be 32,
	green_mult might be 4, and blue_mult might be 1.  For a
	6-colors-each allocation, red_mult might be 36, green_mult might
	be 6, and blue_mult might be 1.

	The field `base_pixel' gives the base pixel value used to
	compose a full pixel value.  Normally base_pixel is obtained
	from a call to XAllocColorPlanes().  Given integer red, green,
	and blue coefficients in their appropriate ranges, one can
	compute a corresponding pixel value with the expression:

		r * red_mult + g * green_mult + b * blue_mult + base_pixel
	
	For gray-scale colormaps, only the colormap, red_max, red_mult,
	and base_pixel fields are defined; the other fields are
	ignored.  To compute a gray-scale pixel value, use:

		gray * red_mult + base_pixel

	This is provided to allow applications to share color maps.

	Property name:	(type: RGB_COLOR_MAP)
		The needs of most applications can be met with five colormaps.
		Polite applications may need only a small RGB space, and can
		use a portion of the default color map. Applications doing
		high-quality RGB rendering will need an entire colormap,
		filled with as large an RGB space as possible, e.g. 332. For
		color separations, an application may need maximum device
		resolution for each of red, green, and blue, even if this
		requires three renderings with three colormaps.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

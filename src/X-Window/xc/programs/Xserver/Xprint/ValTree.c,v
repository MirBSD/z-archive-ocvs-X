 * XpValidateTree - a validateTree routine which ignores overlapping
 * top-level windows when computing the clip lists for such windows.
 * This can be used by any driver which maintains a separate memory
 * store for each top-level window (with its respective children).
 * If the pParent is not the root window, then miValidateTree 
 * is used unmodified.
 *
 * The strategy if pParent is the root is to save off the 
 * current values of pParent->firstChild and pParent->lastChild,
 * replacing both with the single child of interest. We save off
 * pChild->prevSib and pChild->nextSib, and replace them with NullWindow.
 * We save off pParent->clipList, and replace it with 
 * pParent->winSize - pChild->winSize.  We then call miValidateTree
 * to do the needed ComputeClips on the pChild's heirarchy.
 * pParent's clipList is then recomputed based on the sizes
 * of its children, and the saved pointers are restored.
 * The trees associated with the siblings of pChild must be descended
 * and cleaned of any marks (i.e. the valdata pointer freed, and set to NULL),
 * and pParent' AfterValidate structure's exposed field must be updated.

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

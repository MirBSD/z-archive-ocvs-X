/*
 * PclPolyLine()
 * PclPolySegment()
 *
 * Generates PCL code to draw a polyline, or a collection of distinct
 * line segments, clipped by the current clip region.  Since PCL
 * supports clipping to a rectangle, and the clip region is
 * represented as a collection of visible rectangles, we can draw and
 * clip the line by repeatedly drawing the complete line, clipped to
 * each rectangle in the clip region.
 *
 * Since each box in the clipping region generates approximately 30
 * bytes of PCL code, we have to have a way to avoid having a large
 * number of boxes.  The worst problem the case where the clipping
 * region is a collection of one-pixel-high boxes, perhaps arising
 * from a bitmap clip mask, or a region defined by a non-rectangular
 * polygon.
 *
 * To alleviate this problem, we create a second clipping region,
 * which consists of the union of the bounding boxes of each line
 * segment.  (Each bounding box is also increased by some amount
 * related to the current line width to allow for non-zero-width
 * lines, and for the various end and join styles.)  This region is
 * intersected with the "real" clipping region to get the region used
 * to actually clip the polyline.  This should result in a significant
 * reduction in the number of clip rectangles, as the region-handling
 * code should consolidate many of the fragments of one-pixel-high
 * rectangles into larger rectangles.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

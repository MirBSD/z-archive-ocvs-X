 *     fill.h
 *
 *     Created by Brian Kelleher; Oct 1985
 *
 *     Include file for filled polygon routines.
 *
 *     These are the data structures needed to scan
 *     convert regions.  Two different scan conversion
 *     methods are available -- the even-odd method, and
 *     the winding number method.
 *     The even-odd rule states that a point is inside
 *     the polygon if a ray drawn from that point in any
 *     direction will pass through an odd number of
 *     path segments.
 *     By the winding number rule, a point is decided
 *     to be inside the polygon if a ray drawn from that
 *     point in any direction passes through a different
 *     number of clockwise and counter-clockwise path
 *     segments.
 *
 *     These data structures are adapted somewhat from
 *     the algorithm in (Foley/Van Dam) for scan converting
 *     polygons.
 *     The basic algorithm is to start at the top (smallest y)
 *     of the polygon, stepping down to the bottom of
 *     the polygon by incrementing the y coordinate.  We
 *     keep a list of edges which the current scanline crosses,
 *     sorted by x.  This list is called the Active Edge Table (AET)
 *     As we change the y-coordinate, we update each entry in 
 *     in the active edge table to reflect the edges new xcoord.
 *     This list must be sorted at each scanline in case
 *     two edges intersect.
 *     We also keep a data structure known as the Edge Table (ET),
 *     which keeps track of all the edges which the current
 *     scanline has not yet reached.  The ET is basically a
 *     list of ScanLineList structures containing a list of
 *     edges which are entered at a given scanline.  There is one
 *     ScanLineList per scanline at which an edge is entered.
 *     When we enter a new edge, we move it from the ET to the AET.
 *
 *     From the AET, we can implement the even-odd rule as in
 *     (Foley/Van Dam).
 *     The winding number rule is a little trickier.  We also
 *     keep the EdgeTableEntries in the AET linked by the
 *     nextWETE (winding EdgeTableEntry) link.  This allows
 *     the edges to be linked just as before for updating
 *     purposes, but only uses the edges linked by the nextWETE
 *     link as edges representing spans of the polygon to
 *     drawn (as with the even-odd rule).

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

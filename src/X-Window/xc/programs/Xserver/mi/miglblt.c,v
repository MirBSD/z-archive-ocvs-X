    machine-independent glyph blt.
    assumes that glyph bits in snf are written in bytes,
have same bit order as the server's bitmap format,
and are byte padded.  this corresponds to the snf distributed
with the sample server.

    get a scratch GC.
    in the scratch GC set alu = GXcopy, fg = 1, bg = 0
    allocate a bitmap big enough to hold the largest glyph in the font
    validate the scratch gc with the bitmap
    for each glyph
	carefully put the bits of the glyph in a buffer,
	    padded to the server pixmap scanline padding rules
	fake a call to PutImage from the buffer into the bitmap
	use the bitmap in a call to PushPixels

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

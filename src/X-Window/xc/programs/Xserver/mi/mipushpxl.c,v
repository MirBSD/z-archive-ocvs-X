/* miPushPixels -- squeegees the fill style of pGC through pBitMap
 * into pDrawable.  pBitMap is a stencil (dx by dy of it is used, it may
 * be bigger) which is placed on the drawable at xOrg, yOrg.  Where a 1 bit
 * is set in the bitmap, the fill style is put onto the drawable using
 * the GC's logical function. The drawable is not changed where the bitmap
 * has a zero bit or outside the area covered by the stencil.

WARNING:
    this code works if the 1-bit deep pixmap format returned by GetSpans
is the same as the format defined by the mfb code (i.e. 32-bit padding
per scanline, scanline unit = 32 bits; later, this might mean
bitsizeof(int) padding and sacnline unit == bitsizeof(int).)

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@That's what OpenBSD will, probably, ship as XF4 in 3.5
their last sync against XFree86 4.3-current has been
imported into our vendor branch, too

 *
 *     Written by Brian Kelleher; Dec. 1985.
 *
 *     Fill a convex polygon.  If the given polygon
 *     is not convex, then the result is undefined.
 *     The algorithm is to order the edges from smallest
 *     y to largest by partitioning the array into a left
 *     edge list and a right edge list.  The algorithm used
 *     to traverse each edge is an extension of Bresenham's
 *     line algorithm with y as the major axis.
 *     For a derivation of the algorithm, see the author of
 *     this code.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

   these routines all clip.  they assume that anything that has called
them has already translated the points (i.e. pGC->miTranslate is
non-zero, which is howit gets set in iplCreateGC().)

   the number of new scnalines created by clipping ==
MaxRectsPerBand * nSpans.

    FillSolid is overloaded to be used for OpaqueStipple as well,
if fgPixel == bgPixel.  
Note that for solids, PrivGC.rop == PrivGC.ropOpStip


    FillTiled is overloaded to be used for OpaqueStipple, if
fgPixel != bgPixel.  based on the fill style, it uses
{RotatedTile, gc.alu} or {RotatedStipple, PrivGC.ropOpStip}

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

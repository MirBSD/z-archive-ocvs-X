/* Put and Get images on a monochrome frame buffer
 *
 *   we do this by creating a temporary pixmap and making its
 * pointer to bits point to the buffer read in from the client.
 * this works because of the padding rules specified at startup
 *
 * Note that CopyArea must know how to copy a bitmap into the server-format
 * temporary pixmap.
 *
 * For speed, mfbPutImage should allocate the temporary pixmap on the stack.
 *
 *     even though an XYBitmap and an XYPixmap have the same
 * format (for this device), PutImage has different semantics for the
 * two.  XYPixmap just does the copy; XYBitmap takes gc.fgPixel for
 * a 1 bit, gc.bgPixel for a 0 bit, which we notice is exactly
 * like CopyPlane.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

    this works for fonts with glyphs <= 32 bits wide, on an
    arbitrarily deep display.  Use cfbTEGlyphBlt8 for 8 bit displays.

    This should be called only with a terminal-emulator font;
this means that the FIXED_METRICS flag is set, and that
glyphbounds == charbounds.

    in theory, this goes faster; even if it doesn't, it reduces the
flicker caused by writing a string over itself with image text (since
the background gets repainted per character instead of per string.)
this seems to be important for some converted X10 applications.

    Image text looks at the bits in the glyph and the fg and bg in the
GC.  it paints a rectangle, as defined in the protocol dcoument,
and the paints the characters.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@That's what OpenBSD will, probably, ship as XF4 in 3.5
their last sync against XFree86 4.3-current has been
imported into our vendor branch, too

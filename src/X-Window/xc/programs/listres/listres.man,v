.TH LISTRES 1 __xorgversion__
.SH NAME
listres - list resources in widgets
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "listres"
[-option ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fIlistres\fP program generates a list of a widget's resource database.  
The class in which each resource is first defined, the instance and class
name, and the type of each resource is listed.  If no specific widgets
or the \fI-all\fP switch are given, a two-column list of widget names and
their class hierarchies is printed.
.SH OPTIONS
\fIListres\fP accepts all of the standard toolkit command line options along
with those listed below:
.TP 8
.B \-all
This option indicates that \fIlistres\fP should print information for all
known widgets and objects. 
.TP 8
.B \-nosuper
This option indicates that resources that are inherited from a superclass
should not be listed.  This is useful for determining which resources are
new to a subclass.
.TP 8
.B \-variable
This option indicates that widgets should be identified by the names of the
class record variables rather than the class name given in the variable.  This
is useful for distinguishing subclasses that have the same class name as their
superclasses.
.TP 8
.B \-top \fIname\fP
This option specifies the name of the widget to be treated as the top of the
hierarchy.  Case is not significant, and the name may match either the class
variable name or the class name.  The default is ``core''.
.TP 8
.B \-format \fIprintf\-string\fP
This option specifies the \fIprintf\fP-style format string to be used to print
out the name, instance, class, and type of each resource.
.SH "X DEFAULTS"
To be written.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
X(__miscmansuffix__), xrdb(1), appropriate widget documents
.SH "BUGS"
On operating systems that do not support dynamic linking of run-time routines,
this program must have all of its known widgets compiled in.  The sources
provide several tools for automating this process for various widget sets.

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

#
# Anyone who obtained a copy of this work is hereby permitted to freely use,
# distribute, modify, merge, sublicence, give away or sell it as long as the
# authors are given due credit and the following notice is retained:

# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-
# butor be held liable for any damage, directly or indirectly, that origina-
# ted through or is caused by creation or modification of this work.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@That's what OpenBSD will, probably, ship as XF4 in 3.5
their last sync against XFree86 4.3-current has been
imported into our vendor branch, too

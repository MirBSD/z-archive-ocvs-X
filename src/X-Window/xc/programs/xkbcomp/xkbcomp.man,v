.TH XKBCOMP 1 __xorgversion__
.SH NAME
xkbcomp \- compile XKB keyboard description
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xkbcomp
[option] source [ destination ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.I xkbcomp
keymap compiler converts a description of an XKB keymap into one of several
output formats.   The most common use for xkbcomp is to create a compiled
keymap file (.xkm extension) which can be read directly by XKB-capable X
servers or utilities.   The keymap compiler can also produce C header
files or XKB source files.  The C header files produced by xkbcomp can be
included by X servers or utilities that need a built-in default keymap.
The XKB source files produced by \fIxkbcomp\fP are fully resolved and can be 
used to verify that the files which typically make up an XKB keymap
are merged correctly or to create a single file which contains a complete
description of the keymap.
.PP
The \fIsource\fP may specify an X display, or an \fI.xkb\fP or
\fI.xkm\fP file;  unless explicitly specified, the format of \fIdestination\fP
depends on the format of the source.   Compiling a \fI.xkb\fP (keymap source) 
file generates a \fI.xkm\fP (compiled keymap file) by default.   If the 
source is a \fI.xkm\fP file or an X display, \fIxkbcomp\fP generates a 
keymap source file by default.
.PP
If the \fIdestination\fP is an X display, the keymap for the display
is updated with the compiled keymap.
.PP
The name of the \fIdestination\fP is usually computed from the name
of the source, with the extension replaced as appropriate.  When compiling
a single map from a file which contains several maps, \fIxkbcom\fP constructs
the destination file name by appending an appropriate extension to the
name of the map to be used.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.B \-a
Show all keyboard information, reporting implicit or derived information
as a comment.  Only affects \fI.xkb\fP format output.
.TP 8
.B \-C
Produce a C header file as output (.h extension).
.TP 8
.B \-dflts
Compute defaults for any missing components, such as key names.
.TP 8
.B \-I\fIdir\fP
Specifies top-level directories to be searched for files included by the 
keymap description.
.TP 8
.B \-l
List maps that specify the \fImap\fP pattern in any files listed on the
command line (not implemented yet).
.TP 8
.B \-m\ \fIname\fP
Specifies a map to be compiled from an file with multiple entries.
.TP 8
.B \-merge
Merge the compiled information with the map from the server (not implemented
yet).
.TP 8
.B \-o\ \fIname\fP
Specifies a name for the generated output file.  The default is the name of 
the source file with an appropriate extension for the output format.
.TP 8
.B \-opt\ \fIparts\fP
Specifies a list of optional parts.  Compilation errors in any optional parts
are not fatal.  Parts may consist of any combination of the letters \fIc\fP,
\fIg\fP,\fIk\fP,\fIs\fP,\fIt\fP which specify the compatibility map, geometry,
keycodes, symbols and types, respectively.
.TP 8
.B -R\fIdir\fP
Specifies the root directory for relative path names.
.TP 8
.B -synch
Force synchonization for X requests.
.TP 8
.B \-w\ \fIlvl\fP
Controls the reporting of warnings during compilation.  A warning level 
of 0 disables all warnings; a warning level of 10 enables them all.
.TP 8
.B \-xkb
Generate a source description of the keyboard as output (.xkb extension).
.TP 8
.B \-xkm
Generate a compiled keymap file as output (.xkm extension).

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-
# butor be held liable for any damage, directly or indirectly, that origina-

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

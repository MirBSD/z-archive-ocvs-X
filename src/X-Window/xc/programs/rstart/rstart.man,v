.SH NAME
rstart - a sample implementation of a Remote Start client
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "rstart"
[\-c \fIcontext\fP]
[\-g]
[\-l \fIusername\fP]
[\-v]
\fIhostname\fP
\fIcommand args ...\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIRstart\fP is a simple implementation of a Remote Start client as
defined in "A Flexible Remote Execution Protocol Based on \fBrsh\fP".
It uses \fIrsh\fP as its underlying remote execution mechanism.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.B \-c \fIcontext\fP
This option specifies the \fIcontext\fP in which the command is to be
run.  A \fIcontext\fP specifies a general environment the program is to
be run in.  The details of this environment are host-specific; the
intent is that the client need not know how the environment must be
configured.  If omitted, the context defaults to \fBX\fP.  This should
be suitable for running X programs from the host's "usual" X
installation.
.TP 8
.B \-g
Interprets \fIcommand\fP as a \fIgeneric command\fP, as discussed
in the protocol document.  This is intended to allow common applications
to be invoked without knowing what they are called on the remote system.
Currently, the only generic commands defined are \fBTerminal\fP,
\fBLoadMonitor\fP, \fBListContexts\fP, and \fBListGenericCommands\fP.
.TP 8
.B \-l \fIusername\fP
This option is passed to the underlying \fIrsh\fP; it requests that
the command be run as the specified user.
.TP 8
.B \-v
This option requests that \fIrstart\fP be verbose in its operation.
Without this option, \fIrstart\fP discards output from the remote's
\fIrstart\fP helper, and directs the \fIrstart\fP helper to detach
the program from the \fIrsh\fP connection used to start it.  With
this option, responses from the helper are displayed and the resulting
program is not detached from the connection.
.SH NOTES
This is a trivial implementation.  Far more sophisticated implementations
are possible and should be developed.
.PP
Error handling is nonexistant.  Without \fB\-v\fP, error reports from
the remote are discarded silently.  With \fB\-v\fP, error reports are
displayed.
.PP
The $DISPLAY environment variable is passed.  If it starts with a colon,
the local hostname is prepended.  The local domain name should be appended
to unqualified host names, but isn't.
.PP
The $SESSION_MANAGER environment variable should be passed, but isn't.
.PP
X11 authority information is passed for the current display.
.PP
ICE authority information should be passed, but isn't.  It isn't
completely clear how \fIrstart\fP should select what ICE authority
information to pass.
.PP
Even without \fB\-v\fP, the sample \fIrstart\fP helper will leave a
shell waiting for the program to complete.  This causes no real harm
and consumes relatively few resources, but if it is undesirable
it can be avoided by explicitly specifying the "exec" command to the
shell, eg
.EX 0
rstart somehost exec xterm
.EE
This is obviously dependent on the command interpreter being used on
the remote system; the example given will work for the Bourne and C shells.

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@That's what OpenBSD will, probably, ship as XF4 in 3.5
their last sync against XFree86 4.3-current has been

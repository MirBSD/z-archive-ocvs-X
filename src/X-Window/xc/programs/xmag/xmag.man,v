.TH XMAG 1 __xorgversion__
.SH NAME
xmag \- magnify parts of the screen
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xmag
[
.B \-mag
.I magfactor
] [
.B \-source
.I geom
] [
.I \-toolkitoption
\&.\|.\|. ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIxmag\fP program allows you to magnify portions of an X screen.  If no 
explicit region is specified, a square with the pointer in the upper left 
corner is displayed indicating the area to be enlarged.  The area can be 
dragged out to the desired size by pressing Button 2.  Once a region has 
been selected, a window is popped up showing a blown up version of the region 
in which each pixel in the source image is represented by a small square of 
the same color.  Pressing Button1 in the enlargement window 
shows the position and RGB value
of the pixel under the pointer until the button is released.  Typing ``Q'' 
or ``^C'' in the enlargement window exits the program.  The application has
5 buttons across its top.
\fIClose\fP deletes this particular magnification instance.
\fIReplace\fP brings up the rubber band selector again to select another
region for this magnification instance.
\fINew\fP brings up the rubber band
selector to create a new magnification instance.
\fICut\fP puts the magnification image into the primary selection.
\fIPaste\fP copies the primary selection buffer into \fIxmag\fP.
Note that you can cut and paste between \fIxmag\fP and the \fIbitmap\fP
program.  Resizing \fIxmag\fP resizes the magnification area.
\fIxmag\fP preserves
the colormap, visual, and window depth of the source.
.SH WIDGETS
\fIxmag\fP uses the X Toolkit and the Athena Widget Set.
The magnified image is displayed in the Scale widget.  
For more information, see the Athena Widget Set documentation.
Below is the widget structure of the \fIxmag\fP application.
Indentation indicates hierarchical  structure.  The widget class
name is given first, followed by the widget instance name.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>

# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

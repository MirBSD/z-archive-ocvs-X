@# README: Notes about X11-based passphrase dialog for OpenSSH
# created 1999-Nov-21 jmk
# autodate: 2001-Feb-14 04:07

+-------------+
| Description |
+-------------+

This is an X11-based passphrase dialog for use with OpenSSH.  It is
intended to replace the Perl/Tk-based ssh-askpass dialog and
GNOME-based ssh-askpass dialog which formerly accompanied OpenSSH-1.2.
These dialogs are intended to be called from the ssh-add program and
not invoked directly.

The features of x11-ssh-askpass are as follows:

  - Configurable via the standard X resource mechanism
    (/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults, ~/.Xdefaults, xrdb, etc.).
    
  - Require only stock X11 libraries (libXt, libX11, libSM, libICE).
  
  - Can be configured to grab the keyboard and/or pointer (grabs the
    keyboard by default, not the pointer).

The user interface is somewhat different than most password/passphrase
dialogs and more similar to the X11-based passphrase dialog that
accompanies the regular SSH distribution.  Instead of a text field that
fills with asterisks or some other character as the user enters the
passphrase, a series of LED-like areas light up one-by-one with each
passphrase character entered, beginning from the lefthand edge of the
dialog. When they reach the righthand edge, they go dark one-by-one
again, and so on.  This gives the user feedback that passphrase
characters have been entered, but does not provide onlookers with a cue
as to the length of the passphrase.

Pressing the `OK' button accepts the passphrase (even if it is empty),
which is printed on the standard output, and the dialog exits with a
status of zero (success).  Pressing the `Cancel' button discards the
passphrase, and the dialog exits with non-zero status.

The following keystrokes work as expected:

  [Backspace] or [Delete]               Erase previous character
  [Control+U] or [Control+X]            Erase entire passphrase
  [Enter], [Control+M], or [Control+J]  Accept passphrase (OK)
  [Escape]                              Discard passphrase (Cancel)

+------------+
| Installing |
+------------+

x11-ssh-askpass currently uses imake and xmkmf to build.  Here's the
procedure:

  xmkmf
  make includes
  make
  make install
  make install.man

x11-ssh-askpass installs by default in /usr/local/libexec/openssh/.  To
install it somewhere else (for example, /usr/libexec/openssh/) use:

  make install BINDIR=/usr/libexec/openssh

Several different app-defaults files accompany x11-ssh-askpass:

  SshAskpass-1337.ad    - small, dark, and gray
  SshAskpass-NeXTish.ad - a look mildly similar to that of NEXTstep
  SshAskpass-default.ad - the default look
  SshAskpass-green.ad   - somewhat green
  SshAskpass-motif.ad   - a bit like the look of the Motif toolkit

If you wish a look other than the default, perform the following
commands before building (for example):

  rm -f SshAskpass_ad.h
  make includes APP_DEFAULTS=SshAskpass-NeXTish.ad

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

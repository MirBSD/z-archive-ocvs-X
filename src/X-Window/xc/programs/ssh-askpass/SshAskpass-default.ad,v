! X11 does a miserable job of providing resolution-independent drawing
! facilities---it expects everything to be done in pixels.  So if you
! happen to run your X server at a resolution of 100 pixels per inch
! (or some other strange value) instead of the widely used default of
! 75, x11-ssh-askpass looks might tiny.  [Sigh].
! 
! To get around this, umm, limitation, we declare the resolution that
! the spacing and width/height pixels values are "valid" for, along
! with a fuzz factor.  If the current actual resolution is outside of
! the range of <DEFAULT - FUZZ>..<DEFAULT + FUZZ>, then we scale pixel
! measurements to fit the actual resolution.
! 
! (And if you think *this* is a horrid hack, then take a look at the
! actual code, which has to deal with conversion to [cheesy fanfare]
! that's right---millimeters!!!  The right hand managed to slip that
! one in while the left hand was adding a '-dpi' switch to the sample
! server implementation.  I think both left feet were adding the
! RESOLUTION_X and RESOLUTION_Y fields [in dots per inch, naturally]
! to the X Logical Font Description.  The irony is underwhelming.)

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

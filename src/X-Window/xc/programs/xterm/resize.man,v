.TH RESIZE 1 __vendorversion__
.SH NAME
resize \- set TERMCAP and terminal settings to current xterm window size
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B resize
[ \fB\-u\fP | \fB\-c\fP ] [ \fB\-s\fP [ \fIrow col\fP ] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Resize
prints a shell command for setting the TERM and TERMCAP environment variables
to indicate the current size of \fIxterm\fP window from which the command
is run.  For this output to take effect, \fIresize\fP must either be evaluated
as part of the command line (usually done with a shell alias or function) or
else redirected to a file which can then be read in.  From the C shell (usually
known as \fI/bin/csh\fP), the following alias could be defined in the 
user's \fI.cshrc\fP:
.sp
.nf
        %  alias rs 'set noglob; eval \fC`\fPresize\fC`\fP'
.fi
.sp
After resizing the window, the user would type:
.sp
.nf
        %  rs
.fi
.sp
Users of versions of the Bourne shell (usually known as \fI/bin/sh\fP) that 
don't have command
functions will need to send the output to a temporary file and the read it back
in with the ``.'' command:
.sp
.nf
        $  resize > /tmp/out
        $  .\0/tmp/out
.fi
.SH OPTIONS
The following options may be used with \fIresize\fP:
.TP 8
.B \-u
This option indicates that Bourne shell commands should be generated even if 
the user's current shell isn't \fI/bin/sh\fP.
.TP 8
.B \-c
This option indicates that C shell commands should be generated even if the
user's current shell isn't \fI/bin/csh\fP.
.TP 8
.B \-s \fR[\fIrows columns\fP]
This option indicates that Sun console escape sequences will be used 
instead of the VT100-style \fIxterm\fP escape codes.
If \fIrows\fP and
\fIcolumns\fP are given, \fIresize\fP will ask the \fIxterm\fP to resize
itself.  However, the window manager may choose to disallow the change.
.sp
Note that the Sun console escape sequences are recognized
by XFree86 \fIxterm\fP and
by \fIdtterm\fP.
The \fIresize\fP program may be installed as \fIsunsize\fP,
which causes makes it assume the \fB\-s\fP option.
.sp
The \fIrows\fP and
\fIcolumns\fP arguments must appear last; though they are normally
associated with the \fB\-s\fP option, they are parsed separately.
.SH FILES
.TP 15
/etc/termcap
for the base termcap entry to modify.
.TP 15
~/.cshrc
user's alias for the command.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
csh(1), tset(1), xterm(1)

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

/*
 * This module provides test support for curses applications that must work
 * with terminals that have the xmc (magic cookie) glitch.  The xmc_glitch
 * resource denotes the number of spaces that are emitted when switching to or
 * from standout (reverse) mode.  Some terminals implement this by storing the
 * attribute controls in the character cell that is skipped.  So if the cell is
 * overwritten by text, then the attribute change in the cell is cancelled,
 * causing attributes to the left of the change to propagate.
 *
 * We implement the glitch by writing a character that won't be mistaken for
 * other normal characters (and mapping normal writes to that character to a
 * different one).
 *
 * Since xmc isn't normally part of xterm, we document it here rather than in
 * the man-page.  This module is driven by resources rather than by the
 * termcap/terminfo description to make it a little more flexible for testing
 * purposes.
 *
 * Resources:
 *
 * xmcGlitch (class XmcGlitch)
 *	When true, enables this extension.  The default is `0', which disables
 *	the module.  (termcap sg, terminfo xmc).
 *
 * xmcAttributes (class XmcAttributes)
 *	The attributes for which we'll generate a glitch, as a bitmask.
 *
 *		INVERSE		1
 *		UNDERLINE	2
 *		BOLD		4
 *
 *	The default is `1' (INVERSE).  Some terminals emit glitches for
 *	underline.
 *
 * xmcInline (class XmcInline)
 *	When true, limits the extent of an SGR change to the current line.
 *	The default is `false'.  (No termcap or terminfo equivalent, though
 *	there are comments in some entries relating to this issue).
 *
 * xmcMoveSGR (class XmcMoveSGR)
 *	When false, a cursor movement will leave a glitch when SGR's are
 *	active.  The default is `true'.  (termcap ms, terminfo msgr).
 *
 * TODO:
 *	When xmc is active, the terminfo max_attributes (ma) capability is
 *	assumed to be 1.
 *
 *	The xmcAttributes resource should also apply to alternate character
 *	sets and to color.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

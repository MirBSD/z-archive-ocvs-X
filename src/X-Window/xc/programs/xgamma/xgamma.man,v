.SH NAME
xgamma - Alter a monitor's gamma correction for XFree86
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "xgamma"
[-display \fIdisplay\fP] [-screen \fIscreen\fP] [-quiet]
[-gamma f.f | [[-rgamma f.f] [-ggamma f.f] [-bgamma f.f]]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B xgamma
allows X users to query and alter the gamma correction of a monitor via
the XFree86 X server video mode extension (XFree86-VidModeExtension).
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.TP 8
.B "-display \fIdisplay\fP"
This argument allows you to specify the server to connect to; see \fIX(__miscmansuffix__)\fP.
.PP
.TP 8
.B "-screen \fIscreen\fP"
When multiple displays are configured as a single logical display, this option
allows you to select the screen you wish to change.
.PP
.TP 8
.B "-quiet"
Silence the normal output of
.B xgamma
.PP
.TP 8
.B "-help"
Print out the `Usage:' command syntax summary.
.PP
.TP 8
.B "-gamma f.f"
The gamma correction can either be defined as a single value, or
separately for the red, green and blue components. This argument
specifies the gamma correction as a single value. If no value for
the gamma correction is given
.B xgamma
returns the current gamma correction of the display.
.PP
.TP 8
.B "-rgamma f.f"
This argument specifies the red component of the gamma correction.
.PP
.TP 8
.B "-ggamma f.f"
This argument specifies the green component of the gamma correction.
.PP
.TP 8
.B "-bgamma f.f"
This argument specifies the blue component of the gamma correction.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
.TP 8
.B DISPLAY
To get default host and display number.
.SH BUGS
.PP
This client changes the internal values of the gamma correction for the
Xserver. Whether or not these values are respected depends on the video
drivers.
.PP
The gamma values are passed to the Xserver with 3 decimal places of
accuracy.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

#
# Anyone who obtained a copy of this work is hereby permitted to freely use,
# distribute, modify, merge, sublicence, give away or sell it as long as the

# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-
# butor be held liable for any damage, directly or indirectly, that origina-

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

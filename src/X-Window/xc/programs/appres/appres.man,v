.TH APPRES 1 __xorgversion__
.SH NAME
appres \- list X application resource database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "appres"
[[class [instance]] [\-1] [toolkitoptions] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fIappres\fP program prints the resources seen by an application
(or subhierarchy of an application) with the specified \fIclass\fP and
\fIinstance\fP names.  It can be used to determine which
resources a particular program will load.  For example,
.sp 1
.in +.5i
.nf
% appres  XTerm
.fi
.in -.5i
.sp 1
will list the resources that any \fIxterm\fP program will load.
If no application class is specified, the class \fI-AppResTest-\fP is used.
.PP
To match a particular instance name, specify an instance name
explicitly after the class name, or use the normal Xt toolkit option.
For example,
.sp 1
.in +.5i
.nf
% appres  XTerm  myxterm
.fi
.in -.5i
or
.in +.5i
.nf
% appres  XTerm  \-name  myxterm
.fi
.in -.5i
.PP
To list resources that match a subhierarchy of an application, specify
hierarchical class and instance names.  The number of class and instance
components must be equal, and the instance name should not be
specified with a toolkit option.  For example,
.sp 1
.in +.5i
.nf
% appres  Xman.TopLevelShell.Form  xman.topBox.form
.fi
.in -.5i
.sp 1
will list the resources of widgets of \fIxman\fP topBox hierarchy.
To list just the resources matching a specific level in the hierarcy,
use the \-1 option.  For example,
.sp 1
.in +.5i
.nf
% appres  XTerm.VT100  xterm.vt100  \-1
.fi
.in -.5i
.sp 1
will list the resources matching the \fIxterm\fP vt100 widget.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@That's what OpenBSD will, probably, ship as XF4 in 3.5
their last sync against XFree86 4.3-current has been
imported into our vendor branch, too

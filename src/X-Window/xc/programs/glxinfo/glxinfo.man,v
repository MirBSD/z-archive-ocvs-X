.TH GLXINFO 1 __vendorversion__
.SH NAME
glxinfo \- display info about a GLX extension and OpenGL renderer.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "glxinfo"
[\-t]
[\-v]
[\-b]
[\-display \fIdisplayname\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I glxinfo
lists information about the GLX extension, OpenGL capable visuals, and the
OpenGL renderer on an X server. The GLX and renderer info includes the version
and extension attributes. The visual info lists the GLX visual attributes 
available for each OpenGL capable visual (e.g. whether the visual is double
buffered, the component sizes, Z-buffering depth, etc).
.PP
Command line options include:
.TP 8
.B \-t
By default the visual info is presented in a concise 80 character wide
tabular format. The -t option directs glxinfo to produce a wider, more readable
tabular format.
.TP 8
.B \-v
Directs glxinfo to generate a verbose format output style for
the visual list similar to the info of xdpyinfo.
.TP 8
.B \-b
Print the ID of the "best" visual on screen 0.
.TP 8
.BI "\-display " "displayname"
Specify the display to query.
.PP
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
.TP 8
.B DISPLAY
To get the default host, display number, and screen.

Modifications for XFree86 added by Mark Paton

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.TH XKBPRINT 1 __xorgversion__
.SH NAME
xkbprint \- print an XKB keyboard description
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xkbprint 
[options] source [ output_file ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.I xkbprint
comman generates a printable or encapsulated PostScript description of the 
XKB keyboard description specifed by \fIsource\fP.  The \fIsource\fP can be 
any compiled keymap (.xkm) file that includes a geometry description or an 
X display specification.  If an \fIoutput_file\fP is specified, xkbprint 
writes to it.  If no output file is specified, xkbprint creates replaces
the extension of the source file with \fI.ps\fP or \fI.eps\fP depending
on the requested format.  If the source is a non-local X display (e.g.:0), 
xkbprint appends the appropriate prefix to the display specification, 
replacing the colon with a dash.  For a local display, xkprint uses
server-\fIn\fP where \fIn\fP is the number of the display.
.SH OPTIONS

.B \-color
Print using the colors specified in the geometry file;  by default, xkbprint
prints a black-and-white image of the keyboard.
.TP 8
.B \-dflts
Attempt to compute default names for any missing components, such as keys.
.TP 8
.B \-diffs

.TP 8
.B \-if\ \fIfontName\fP
Specifies an internal PostScript type 1 font to dump to the specified
output file or to \fIfontName\fP.pfa, if no output file is specified.
No keyboard description is printed if an internal font is dumped.
.TP 8
.B \-label\ \fItype\fP
Specifies the labels to be printed on keys;  legal types are: \fInone\fP,
\fIname\fP,\fIcode\fP,\fIsymbols\fP.
.TP 8
.B \-lc\ \fI<locale>\fP
Specifies a locale in which KeySyms should be resolved.

.B \-ll\ \fIlevel\fP
Print symbols starting from shift level \fIlevel\fP.
.TP 8
.B \-mono
Generate black-and-white image of keyboard (default).

.TP 8
.B \-o\ \fIfile\fP
Write output to \fIfile\fP.
.TP 8
.B \-R\fIdirectory\fP
Use \fIdirectory\fP as the root directory; all path names are interpreted
relative to \fIdirectory\fP.
.TP 8
.B -pict \fIwhich\fP
Controls use of pictographs instead of keysym names where available. 
\fIwhich\fP can be any of \fIall\fP, \fInone\fP, or \fIcommon\fP(default).

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@That's what OpenBSD will, probably, ship as XF4 in 3.5
their last sync against XFree86 4.3-current has been
imported into our vendor branch, too

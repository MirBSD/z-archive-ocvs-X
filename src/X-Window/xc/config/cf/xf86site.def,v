 * These are the most common settings you would choose for compiling and
 * installing XFree86 on the systems supported by it.
 *
 * A good way to use this file is to copy it to host.def, and make the
 * changes there.  That way, future patches to this file won't fail.
 * The host.def file will never be patched.

 * The distributed version of this file should contain no uncommented

log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

.TH MAKESTRS 1 __xorgversion__
.SH NAME
makestrs \- makes string table C source and header(s)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B makestrs [-f source] [-abioptions ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I makestrs
command creates string table C source files and headers.
If
.I -f
.I source
is not specified
.I makestrs
will read from
.I stdin.
The C source file is always written to
.I stdout.
.I makestrs
creates one or more C header files as specified in the source file.
The following options may be specified:
.I -sparcabi,
.I -intelabi,
.I -functionabi,
.I -arrayperabi,
and
.I -defaultabi.
.LP
.I -sparcabi 
is used on SPARC platforms conforming to the SPARC 
Compliance Definition, i.e. SVR4/Solaris.
.LP
.I -intelabi 
is used on Intel platforms conforming to the System 
V Application Binary Interface, i.e. SVR4.
.LP
.I -earlyR6abi 
may be used in addition to 
.I -intelabi 
for situations 
where the vendor wishes to maintain binary compatiblity between 
X11R6 public-patch 11 (and earlier) and X11R6 public-patch 12 (and later).
.LP
.I -functionabi 
generates a functional abi to the string table. This 
mechanism imposes a severe performance penalty and it's recommended 
that you not use it.
.LP
.I -arrayperabi 
results in a separate array for each string. This is 
the default behavior if makestrs was compiled with -DARRAYPERSTR 
(it almost never is).
.LP
.I -defaultabi 
forces the generation of the "normal" string table even 
if makestrs was compiled with -DARRAYPERSTR. Since makestrs is almost 
never compiled with -DARRAYPERSTR this is the default behavior if 
no abioptions are specified.

.LP
In words you may have one or more #file directives. Each #file may have
one or more #table directives.
.LP
The #prefix directive determines the string that makestr will prefix
to each definition.
.LP
The #feature directive determines the string that makestr will use
for the feature-test macro, e.g. X[TM]STRINGDEFINES.
.LP
The #externref directive determines the string that makestr will use
for the extern clause, typically this will be "extern" but Motif wants
it to be "externalref"
.LP
The #externdef directive determines the string that makestr will use
for the declaration, typically this will be the null string (note that
makestrs requires a trailing space in this case, i.e. "#externdef "),
and Motif will use "externaldef(_xmstrings).
.LP
The #ctmpl directive determines the name of the file used as a template
for the C source file that is generated
.LP
Each #file <filename> directive will result in a corresponding header 
file by that name containing the appropriate definitions as specified
by command line options. A single C source file containing the
declarations for the definitions in all the headers will be printed
to stdout.
.LP
The #htmpl directive determines the name of the file used as a template
for the C header file that is generated.
.LP
Each #table <tablename> directive will be processed in accordance with
the ABI. On most platforms all tables will be catenated into a single
table with the name of the first table for that file. To conform to
the Intel ABI separate tables will be generated with the names indicated.
.LP
The template files specified by the #ctmpl and #htmpl directives
are processed by copying line for line from the template file to
the appropriate output file. The line containing the string
.I <<<STRING_TABLE_GOES_HERE>>>
is not copied to the output file. The appropriate data is then
copied to the output file and then the remainder of the template
file is copied to the output file.
.SH BUGS
makestrs is not very forgiving of syntax errors. Sometimes you need
a trailing space after # directives, other times they will mess you
up. No warning messages are emitted.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@That's what OpenBSD will, probably, ship as XF4 in 3.5
their last sync against XFree86 4.3-current has been

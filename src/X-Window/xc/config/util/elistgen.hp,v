XCOMM Construct shared-library export lists for HP-UX based on standardized
XCOMM export list description file
XCOMM
XCOMM Usage: exportlistgen libfoo.sl libfoo.elist > libfoo.lopt
XCOMM
XCOMM	libfoo.sl    => shared library of interest
XCOMM	libfoo.elist => Meta description of necessary export list.
XCOMM
XCOMM The output may then be passed to the linker to reconstruct the
XCOMM shared library.  For unknown reasons naming only exported symbols
XCOMM with "+e" does not work for debuggable C++ code, even though "nm"
XCOMM reports no difference between the resulting libraries.  The linker
XCOMM complains that "first non-inline virtual function" is not defined for
XCOMM vtables.  We instead hide internal symbols with "-h" as a work-around.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

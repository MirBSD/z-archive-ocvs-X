@Initial revision

@The mkshadow programs makes a "shadow tree" of a directory tree.
It logically copies all of the "MASTER" directory into ".".
However, ordinary files, and RCS/SCCS directories are "copied"
by creating a sybolic link to the corresponding file in MASTER.

The wildmat.c file is by Rich Salz, and from comp.sources.misc, volume 17.
The savedir.c file is lightly modified from the version written
by David MacKenzie for GNU fileutils; the Free Software Foundation
has graciously agreed to waive their usual copyright so this
program can be distributed by the X Consortium.

If you have problems compiling savedir.c, try setting the DIRENT make
variable as suggested in the Makefile.

 * Usage: mkshadow [-X exclude_file] [-x exclude_pattern] ... MASTER
 * Makes the current directory be a "shadow copy" of MASTER.
 * Sort of like a recursive copy of MASTER to .
 * However, symbolic links are used instead of actually
 * copying (non-directory) files.
 * Also, directories named RCS or SCCS are shared (with a symbolic link).
 * Warning messages are printed for files (and directories) in .
 * that don't match a corresponding file in MASTER (though
 * symbolic links are silently removed).
 * Also, a warning message is printed for non-directory files
 * under . that are  not symbolic links.
 *
 * Files and directories can be excluded from the sharing
 * with the -X and -x flags. The flag `-x pattern' (or `-xpattern')
 * means that mkshadow should ignore any file whose name matches
 * the pattern. The pattern is a "globbing" pattern, i.e. the
 * characters *?[^-] are interpreted as by the shell.
 * If the pattern contains a '/' is is matched against the complete
 * current path (relative to '.'); otherwise, it is matched
 * against the last component of the path.
 * A `-X filename' flag means to read a set of exclusion patterns
 * from the named file, one pattern to a line.

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.TH REVPATH 1 __vendorversion__
.SH NAME
revpath \- generate a relative path that can be used to undo a change-directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B revpath
.I path
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I revpath
program prints out a relative path that is the ``reverse'' or ``inverse'' of
.IR path .
Start with two directories
.I top
and
.IR bottom ,
with the latter below the former, and
.I path
is the location of
.I bottom
relative to
.IR top .
The output of
.I revpath
is the location of
.I top
relative to
.IR bottom .
The resulting path contains a trailing `/' character when the result is
non-trivial.
If
.I path
is equivalent to `.', the resulting output is empty.
If
.I path
is invalid in some way (e.g., doesn't represent the path to a subdirectory)
the output is also empty and no error messages are ever generated.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
There are no diagnostics.  Error conditions are silently ignored, and the
exit status is always 0.
.SH BUGS
It isn't possible to reverse arbitrary relative paths.
If any path element between the two end points of
.I path
is a symbolic link, the results will probably be incorrect.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

/*
 * The purpose of this header is to define the macros ALLOCATE_LOCAL and
 * DEALLOCATE_LOCAL appropriately for the platform being compiled on.
 * These macros are used to make fast, function-local memory allocations.
 * Their characteristics are as follows:
 *
 * void *ALLOCATE_LOCAL(int size)
 *    Returns a pointer to size bytes of memory, or NULL if the allocation
 *    failed.  The memory must be freed with DEALLOCATE_LOCAL before the
 *    function that made the allocation returns.  You should not ask for
 *    large blocks of memory with this function, since on many platforms
 *    the memory comes from the stack, which may have limited size.
 *
 * void DEALLOCATE_LOCAL(void *)
 *    Frees the memory allocated by ALLOCATE_LOCAL.  Omission of this
 *    step may be harmless on some platforms, but will result in
 *    memory leaks or worse on others.
 *
 * Before including this file, you should define two macros,
 * ALLOCATE_LOCAL_FALLBACK and DEALLOCATE_LOCAL_FALLBACK, that have the
 * same characteristics as ALLOCATE_LOCAL and DEALLOCATE_LOCAL.  The
 * header uses the fallbacks if it doesn't know a "better" way to define
 * ALLOCATE_LOCAL and DEALLOCATE_LOCAL.  Typical usage would be:
 *
 *    #define ALLOCATE_LOCAL_FALLBACK(_size) malloc(_size)
 *    #define DEALLOCATE_LOCAL_FALLBACK(_ptr) free(_ptr)
 *    #include "Xalloca.h"

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

   parameter has the same meaning as in deflateInit.  sourceLen is the byte
   length of the source buffer. Upon entry, destLen is the total size of the
   destination buffer, which must be at least 0.1% larger than sourceLen plus
   12 bytes. Upon exit, destLen is the actual size of the compressed buffer.

     compress2 returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough
   memory, Z_BUF_ERROR if there was not enough room in the output buffer,
   Z_STREAM_ERROR if the level parameter is invalid.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

#
# Anyone who obtained a copy of this work is hereby permitted to freely use,
# distribute, modify, merge, sublicence, give away or sell it as long as the
# authors are given due credit and the following notice is retained:

# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-
# butor be held liable for any damage, directly or indirectly, that origina-
# ted through or is caused by creation or modification of this work.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

/* FFB fog support:
 *
 * There are two levels of support for FOG in the Creator3D series.
 * Both involve a depth cue unit and 1 or 4 slope factors and scales
 * for varying the pixel intensity.
 *
 * Chips prior to FFB2 only have a single set of such settings, FFB2
 * and later have 4 settings.
 *
 * The basic depth cueing equation is:
 *
 *	C_final = dcsf(z) * C_orig + (1 - dcsf(z)) * C_fog
 *
 * 	C_final	--	The final color passed to blend unit or frame
 *			buffer (if blending is disabled).
 *
 *	C_orig	--	The color we start with, which comes either from
 *			the raster processor or cpu writes to the smart
 *			framebuffer aperture.
 *
 *	C_fog	--	This is the "fog" color, ie. the desired color
 *			at the deepest Z.
 *
 *	dcsf(z)	--	The depth cue scale as a function of Z.
 *
 * With pre-FFB2 chips there are four parameters to control the depth
 * cue scaling.  Here is a diagram:
 *
 *		   1.0	-------------
 *			|   |   |   |
 *			|   |   |   |
 *		Sfront	XXXXX---+---+
 *			|   |X  |   |
 *	dcsf(z)		|   | X |   |
 *			|   |  X|   |
 *		Sback	+---+---XXXXX
 *			|   |   |   |
 *		   0.0	-------------
 *			0.0 Zf  Zb 1.0
 *
 *			      z
 * Therefore:
 *
 *	for Zf < z < Zb
 *
 *		dcsf(z) = Sback + ((Sfront - Sback) / (Zf - Zb)) * (Zb - z)
 *
 *	for z <= Zf
 *
 *		dcsf(z) = Sfront
 *
 *	for z >= Zb
 *
 *		dcsf(z) = Sback
 *
 * With FFB2 and later, 3 more slope regions are provided, the first of
 * them starts at the end of the region defined above and ends at a
 * specified depth value, the next slop region starts there and ends
 * at the next specified depth value, and so on.  Each of the 3 slope
 * regions also have scale and slope settings of their own.
 *
 * The C_fog color is programmed into the alpha blending unit color1
 * and color2 registers as follows:
 *
 *	color1:		-(C_fog)
 *	color2:		C_fog - bg
 *
 * If alpha blending is disabled, the bg factor is zero.  Note that
 * the alpha blending color registers specify each of the RGB values
 * as 9 bit 1:8 signed numbers in the range -1.00 to 0.ff inclusive.
 * (ie. 0x100 == -1.00 and 0x0ff == +0.ff)

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

/*
 * To create all of the appropriate standard colormaps for every visual of
 * every screen on a given display, use XmuAllStandardColormaps.
 *
 * Define and retain as permanent resources all standard colormaps which are
 * meaningful for the visuals of each screen of the display.  Return 0 on
 * failure, non-zero on success.  If the property of any standard colormap 
 * is already defined, redefine it.
 *
 * This interface is intended to be used by window managers or a client
 * upon start-up of a session.
 *
 * The standard colormaps of a screen are defined by properties associated
 * with the screen's root window.  Each screen has exactly one root window.
 * The property names of standard colormaps are predefined, and each property
 * name may describe at most one colormap.
 * 
 * The standard colormaps are
 *		RGB_BEST_MAP
 *		RGB_RED_MAP
 *		RGB_GREEN_MAP
 *		RGB_BLUE_MAP
 *		RGB_DEFAULT_MAP
 *		RGB_GRAY_MAP
 *
 * Therefore a screen may have at most 6 standard colormap properties defined.
 *
 * A standard colormap is associated with a particular visual of the screen.
 * A screen may have multiple visuals defined, including visuals of the same
 * class at different depths.  Note that a visual id might be repeated for
 * more than one depth, so the visual id and the depth of a visual identify
 * the visual.  The characteristics of the visual will determine which
 * standard colormaps are meaningful under that visual, and will determine
 * how the standard colormap is defined.  Because a standard colormap is
 * associated with a specific visual, there must be a method of determining
 * which visuals take precedence in defining standard colormaps.
 * 
 * The method used here is: for the visual of greatest depth, define all 
 * standard colormaps meaningful to that visual class, according to this
 * order of (descending) precedence:
 *	1. DirectColor
 *	2. PseudoColor
 *	3. TrueColor and GrayScale
 *	4. StaticColor and StaticGray
 *
 * Allows partial success by screenful.  For example, if a map on screen 1
 * fails, the maps on screen 0, created earlier, will remain.  However,
 * none on screen 1 will remain.  If a map on 0 fails, none will remain.
 *
 * See the comments under XmuVisualStandardColormaps() for notes on which
 * standard colormaps are meaningful under these classes of visuals.

1.1.9.1

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

/************************************************************

		The Editres Protocol


  The Client message sent to the application is:

  ATOM = "ResEditor" 		--- RES_EDITOR_NAME

  FORMAT = 32                   --- RES_EDIT_SEND_EVENT_FORMAT

  l[0] = timestamp
  l[1] = command atom name
  l[2] = ident of command
  l[3] = protocol version number to use



  The binary protocol has the following format:

	Card8:		8-bit unsingned integer
	Card16:		16-bit unsingned integer
	Card32:		32-bit unsingned integer
	Int16:		16-bit signed integer
	Window:		32-bit value
	Widget:		32-bit value
	String8:        ListOfCard8
	
	[a][b][c] represent an exclusive list of choices.

	All widgets are passed as a list of widgets, containing the 
	full instance heirarch of this widget.  The hierarchy is ordered
	from parent to child.  Thus the first element of each list is
	the root of the widget tree (this makes verifying that the widget
	still exists, MUCH faster).

	ListOfFoo comprises a list of things in the following format:
	
	number:			Card16
	<number> things:	????
	
  This is a synchronous protocol, every request MUST be followed by a
  reply.  

  Request:

	Serial Number:	Card8
	Op Code:	Card8 -	{ SendWidgetTree = 0,
				  SetValues = 1,
				  GetResources = 2,
				  GetGeometry = 3,
				  FindChild = 4,
				  GetValues = 5 }
	Length:		Card32
	Data:		

   Reply:

	Serial Number:	Card8
	Type:		Card8 - { Formatted = 0,
	                          Unformatted = 1,
				  ProtocolMismatch = 2
				}
	Length:		Card32


   Byte Order:

	All Fields are MSB -> LSB

    Data:

    	Formatted:

        	The data contains the reply information for the request as
		specified below if the reply type is "Formatted".  The return
		values for the other reply types are shown below.

        Unformatted:

		Message:	String8

	ProtocolMismatch:

		RequestedVersion:   	Card8

------------------------------------------------------------

   SendWidgetTree:

	--->

	Number of Entries:	Card16
	Entry:
		widget:		ListOfWidgets
		name:		String8
		class:		String8
		window:		Card32
         	toolkit:        String8

	Send Widget Tree returns the toolkit type, and a fuly specified list
        of widgets for each widget in the tree.  This is enough information
        to completely reconstruct the entire widget heirarchy.

	The window return value contains the Xid of the window currently 
	used by this widget.  If the widget is unrealized then 0 is returned,
	and if widget is a non-windowed object a value of 2 is returned.

   SetValues:

	name:	String8
	type:	String8
	value:  String8
	Number of Entries:	Card16
	Entry:
		widget:		ListOfWidgets

	--->

	Number of Entries:	Card16
	Entry:
		widget:		ListOfWidgets
		message:	String8

	SetValues will allow the same resource to be set on a number of 
	widgets.  This function will return an error message if the SetValues
	request caused an Xt error.
	
  GetValues:

        names:                ListOfString8       
        widget:               Widget

        --->
	novalues:             ListOfCard16
	values:               ListOfString8
                   
        GetValues will allow a number of resource values to be read 
        on a particular widget.  The request specifies the names of
	the resources wanted and the widget id these resources are
	from.  The reply returns a list of indices from the requests
	name list of resources for which a value can not be returned.
	It also returns a list of returned values, in the order of the
        requests names list, skipping those indices present in novalues.

   GetResources:

	Number of Entries:	Card16
	Entry
		widget:		ListOfWidgets:

	---->

	Number of Entries:	Card16
	Entry
		Widget:			ListOfWidgets:
		Error:			Bool

		[ Message:		String 8 ]
		[ Number of Resources:	Card16
		Resource:
			Kind:	{normal, constraint}
			Name:	String8
			Class:	String8	
			Type:	String8 ]

	GetResource retrieves the kind, name, class and type for every 
	widget passed to it.  If an error occured with the resource fetch
	Error will be set to True for the given widget and a message
	is returned rather than the resource info.

  GetGeometry:

	Number of Entries:	Card16
	Entry
		Widget:		ListOfWidgets:

	---->

	Number of Entries:	Card16
	Entry
		Widget:			ListOfWidgets:
		Error:			Bool

		[ message:		String 8 ]
		[ mapped:       Boolean
		  X: 		Int16
		  Y:  		Int16
		  Width: 	Card16
	      	  Height:	Card16
		  BorderWidth:	Card16 ]

	GetGeometry retreives the mapping state, x, y, width, height
	and border width for each widget specified.  If an error occured 
	with the geometry fetch "Error" will be set to True for the given 
	widget and a message is returned rather than the geometry info.  
	X an Y corrospond to the root coordinates of the upper left corner
	of the widget (outside the window border).
	
  FindChild:

	Widget:		ListOfWidgets
	X:		Int16
	Y:		Int16
	
	--->

	Widget:		ListOfWidgets

	Find Child returns a descendent of the widget specified that 
	is at the root coordinates specified.

	NOTE:

	The returned widget is undefined if the point is contained in
	two or more mapped widgets, or in two overlapping Rect objs.

  GetValues:

        names:                ListOfString8       
        widget:               Widget

        --->
	
	values:               ListOfString8

        GetValues will allow a number of resource values to be read 
        on a particular widget.  Currently only InterViews 3.0.1 Styles 
	and their attributes are supported.  In addition, the current
	user interface  only supports the return of 1 resource.  The ability
	to specify and return multiple resources is defined for future editres
	interfaces where some or all of a widgets resource values are returned
	and displayed at once.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

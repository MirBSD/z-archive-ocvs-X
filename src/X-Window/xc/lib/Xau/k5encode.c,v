 * XauKrb5Encode

 * follows:
 *   length count of the realm name
 *   realm
 *   component count
 *   length of component
 *   actual principal component
 *   etc....
 *
 * Note that this function allocates a hunk of memory, which must be
 * freed to avoid nasty memory leak type things.  All counts are
 * byte-swapped if needed. (except for the total length returned)
 *
 * nevermind.... stuffing the encoded packet in net byte order just to
 * always do the right thing.  Don't have to frob with alignment that way.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B X-Resource
is an extension that allows a client to query the X
server about its usage of various resources. It should not be mixed
with the X resource database access functions.
.PP
.B XResQueryExtension
returns
.B True
if the 
.I XRes
extension is available on the given display.
A client must call 
.B XResQueryExtension
before calling any other XRes function in order
to negotiate a compatible protocol version; otherwise the client will
get undefined behavior (XRes may or may not work).
.PP
.B XResQueryVersion
returns
.B True
if the request succeeded; the values of the major and minor protocol
versions supported by the server are returned in 
.I major_versionp 
and 
.I minor_versionp .
.PP
.PP
.B XResQueryClients 
fills a list of clients of the given display. For each client it
returns in the 
.I XResClient
structure a mask and a base value of the resources used by these
clients. 
Returns 
.B True
on success or 
.B False
on failure. 
.PP
.B XResQueryClientResources
fills a list of 
XResType
structures, indicating for each resource type allocated by the client its
name (as an Atom) and the number of resources of this type allocated. 
Returns 
.B True
on success or 
.B False
on failure. 
.PP
.B XresQueryClientPixmapBytes
gives, for resources of type 
.I PIXMAP
the total number of bytes allocated in the X server by the given
client. 
Returns 
.B True
on success or 
.B False
on failure. 
.SH "ERRORS"
.B XResQueryClientResources
and
.B XResQueryClientPixmapBytes
will return 
.I BadValue
if passed an illegal client identifier. 
.SH "SEE ALSO"

@That's what OpenBSD will, probably, ship as XF4 in 3.5
their last sync against XFree86 4.3-current has been
imported into our vendor branch, too

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

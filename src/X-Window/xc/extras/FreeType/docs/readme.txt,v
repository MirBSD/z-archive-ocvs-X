@Welcome to the documentation directory of FreeType.

Here are short overview where you can find which information.


  apiref.txt    FreeType high-level  API reference.  All  the types,
                functions, and error codes of FreeType.

  ..................................................................

  apirefx.txt   The API reference  of FreeType extensions which come
                with the library itself.

  ..................................................................

  bitmaps.txt   How to render a glyph outline into a bitmap.

  ..................................................................

  changes.txt   Guess what :-)

  ..................................................................

  convntns.txt  The  FreeType developer's conventions  guide.  Lists
                the  design  and  coding  conventions  used  in  the
                engine's  source  code.  This file is incomplete but
                contains information  that  should  be  read  by any
                person willing to hack the FreeType code.

  ..................................................................

  credits       A list of persons who have contributed to FreeType.

  ..................................................................

  glyphs.htm    An introduction  to glyphs in general,  its usage in
  glyphs.txt    TrueType, and  how FreeType handles  them.  The file
                `glyphs.txt'  is  a  simple  text  dump  (done  with
                Netscape) of glyphs.htm.

  ..................................................................

  i18n.txt      A short introduction to the GNU gettext package.

  ..................................................................

  porting.txt   The  FreeType  porting   guide.   All  you  need  to
                configure  and adapt  very  easily FreeType's source
                code to tailor it to your own platform.

                Learn how to provide your own memory, i/o, and mutex
                components,  optimally fitted  to your  system.  See
                how you can build a singly-threaded, thread-safe, or
                re-entrant  version  of  the  engine from  the  same
                source code!

  ..................................................................

  raster.txt    The  scan-line converter's internals explained.  The
                document is  still incomplete but  presents many key
                concepts.

  ..................................................................

  threads.txt   How to use threads with FreeType.

  ..................................................................

  user.txt      FreeType's  user  guide.    A  guide  to  FreeType's
                concepts, a  step by step example, and  a note about
                future works and projects.

  ..................................................................

  FAQ           The new up-to-date FreeType FAQ.  Look here first if 
                you have problems with the library.

  ..................................................................

  TODO          Things which probably will come, which would be nice
                to have, problems still here, etc.



These  documents will probably  come later.

  develop.txt   The FreeType developer's guide. All you need to know
                in order to be able  to understand and even hack the
                engine's core source code.

  extend.txt    The FreeType extension writer's how-to. All you need
                to be able to provide new extensions to the engine.

  undoc.txt     Undocumented TrueType!

                Yes,    ladies   and    gentlemen,    the   TrueType
                specification  is  fuzzy  and misleading  enough  to
                disband some serious commercial developers, but that
                wasn't enough for us.  Even though it took some time
                (aaargh...), we finally discovered through hard work
                the real  meanings of  the specs, fixed  some errors
                and even found  surprising undocumented behaviour or
                features!

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@remove a bunch of files not used in MirBSD - clean tree. People who want them got cvs.
@

@This directory contains several extensions to the core engine.

An extension is a separately  compilable unit which can be linked by
a client application to add new functionalities to the engine.

There  are two  kinds  of extensions:  an  `API extension'  provides
clients with new APIs to  access internal engine structures or data,
while an  `engine extension' implements  new TrueType data  or table
management.

This directory contains the following:

  ftxcmap:  An API extension to iterate over cmaps.

  ftxgasp:  A simple API extension which returns the TrueType `gasp'
            table to client applications, when found in a font file.
            Though this table is  always loaded by the engine, there
            is no function in the core API to access it.  The reason
            is simple:  to demonstrate  a simple API  extension with
            `ftxgasp'!

  ftxkern:  This engine  extension is  used to access  kerning data,
            when available in a  font file.  Note that it implements
            on-the-fly  loading and  retrieving  of kerning  tables.
            However, it  doesn't interpret or process  the data, and
            client  applications  should  use  it according  to  the
            TrueType specification.

  ftxpost:  An engine  extension to load the  PostScript glyph names
            of the  `post' table.   See the `ftzoom'  program for an
            example how to use it.

  ftxwidth: A simple  extension used to load the  widths and heights
            of  a given  range of  glyphs  in a  face.  Results  are
            expressed in  unscaled font units.  This  is required by
            the  latest version of  the FreeType/2  DLL to  speed up
            font loading in the  GRE (the OS/2 GRaphics Engine).  It
            can be used by other applications though...

  ftxerr18: This extension  simply converts a  TrueType engine error
            code into  a corresponding string  describing the error.
            It is  useful if you intend  to write a  package for end
            users and  want to  give them not  `Error code  135' but
            `OS/2  table   missing'.   See  docs/errstr.txt   for  a
            description  how to use  it (really  simple!).  ftxerr18
            supports localization  of error strings  (that is: error
            strings  are  automatically  translated  into  supported
            languages)  using  gettext().   See docs/i18n.txt  about
            using gettext.

  ftxsbit:  Embedded bitmap  support.  This is an engine  extension.
            See e.g. the `ftstrtto' program for its usage.

  ftxopen,
  ftxgsub,
  ftxgpos,
  ftxgdef:  This is  experimental stuff  for TrueType Open  support!
            Please ignore it or help debugging :-)

1.1.9.1

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

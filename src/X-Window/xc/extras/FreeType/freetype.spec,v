@Summary: FreeType library
Name: freetype
Version: 1.3.1
Release: 1
Source: ftp://ftp.freetype.org/pub/freetype/freetype-%{version}.tar.gz
URL: http://www.freetype.org/
Copyright: BSD-Like
Group: Libraries
BuildRoot: /var/tmp/freetype

%description
The FreeType engine is a free and portable TrueType font rendering
engine.  It has been developed to provide TrueType support to a
great variety of platforms and environments.

Note that FreeType is a *library*.  It is not a font server for your
favorite platform, even though it was designed to be used in many of
them.  Note also that it is *not* a complete text-rendering library.
Its purpose is simply to open and manage font files, as well as
load, hint and render individual glyphs efficiently.  You can also
see it as a `TrueType driver' for a higher-level library, though
rendering text with it is extremely easy, as demo-ed by the test
programs.

This package contains the files needed to run programs that use the
FreeType engine.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

dnl AC_LIBRARY_NET: Id: net.m4,v 1.4 1997/10/25 20:49:53 jhawk Exp 
dnl
dnl This test is for network applications that need socket() and
dnl gethostbyname() -ish functions.  Under Solaris, those applications need to
dnl link with "-lsocket -lnsl".  Under IRIX, they should *not* link with
dnl "-lsocket" because libsocket.a breaks a number of things (for instance:
dnl gethostbyname() under IRIX 5.2, and snoop sockets under most versions of
dnl IRIX).
dnl 
dnl Unfortunately, many application developers are not aware of this, and
dnl mistakenly write tests that cause -lsocket to be used under IRIX.  It is
dnl also easy to write tests that cause -lnsl to be used under operating
dnl systems where neither are necessary (or useful), such as SunOS 4.1.4, which
dnl uses -lnsl for TLI.
dnl 
dnl This test exists so that every application developer does not test this in
dnl a different, and subtly broken fashion.
dnl 
dnl It has been argued that this test should be broken up into two seperate
dnl tests, one for the resolver libraries, and one for the libraries necessary
dnl for using Sockets API. Unfortunately, the two are carefully intertwined and
dnl allowing the autoconf user to use them independantly potentially results in
dnl unfortunate ordering dependancies -- as such, such component macros would
dnl have to carefully use indirection and be aware if the other components were
dnl executed. Since other autoconf macros do not go to this trouble, and almost
dnl no applications use sockets without the resolver, this complexity has not
dnl been implemented.
dnl
dnl The check for libresolv is in case you are attempting to link statically
dnl and happen to have a libresolv.a lying around (and no libnsl.a).

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@That's what OpenBSD will, probably, ship as XF4 in 3.5
their last sync against XFree86 4.3-current has been
imported into our vendor branch, too

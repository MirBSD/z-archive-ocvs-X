                   The FREE TrueType Font Engine


       Copyright (C) 1996-1999 The FreeType Development Team



  The FreeType engine is a free and portable TrueType font rendering
  engine, available in  ANSI C and Pascal source  code.  It has been
  developed  to  provide TrueType  support  to  a  great variety  of
  platforms and environments.
  
  Notice that  FreeType is a *library*.   It is *not*  a font server
  for your  preferred environment, even though it  has been designed
  to  be the  basis of  many  high-level libraries,  tools and  font
  servers.

  WE  HAVE  RECENTLY  DISCOVERED  THAT APPLE  OWNS  SEVERAL  PATENTS
  RELATED TO THE RENDERING OF  TRUETYPE FONTS.  THIS COULD MEAN THAT
  THE FREE USE OF THE FREETYPE  LIBRARY MIGHT BE ILLEGAL IN THE USA,
  JAPAN,  AND POSSIBLY  OTHER COUNTRIES.   FOR MORE  INFORMATION, WE

  It's  a clean-room  implementation that  is not  derived  from the
  original TrueType engine developed  by Apple and Microsoft, though
  it matches it regarding rendering quality.  To our knowledge, it's
  the only royalty-free complete TrueType engine available.

  Version 1.3.1  fixes several bugs found  in 1.3.

  Version 1.3  fixes several bugs found  in 1.2, as  well as provide
  the engine  with enhanced capabilities, like  support for embedded
  bitmaps and rudimentary TrueType Open support.

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@remove a bunch of files not used in MirBSD - clean tree. People who want them got cvs.

@#       Makefile for FTIFI using IBM VisualAge C++
#
# Explanation of compiler switches used:
#  -C        compile only, do not link
#  -Sp1      pack structures on byte boundaries (quite important)
#  -Ss       accept double slash (//) comments
#  -Ge-      build a DLL
#  -Rn       build a subsystem DLL; means that a special C library is
#            linked and some calls cannot be used
#  -Fo<name> create object file <name>
#  -O+       optimizations on
#  -G4       optimize for 486 (should be better for my 6x86MX, produces smaller
#            code than Pentium optimization)
# Linker switches used:
#  /DE       include debug info in executable
#  /NOE      no extended dictionary search
#  /E:2      exepack (for Warp 3 and higher)
#  /A:32     align pages of code on 32-byte boundaries (makes smaller file)
#  /DBGPACK  pack debug info

# uncomment ICCR and LNKR to build a release version
ICCR=-O+ -G4
LNKR=/PACKC /PACKD /M /A:32 /E:2
# uncomment ICCD and LNKD to build a debug version. Note that debug and
# release version is not mutually exclusive in this case.
#ICCD=-Ti+ -DDEBUG
#ICCD=-Ti+

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

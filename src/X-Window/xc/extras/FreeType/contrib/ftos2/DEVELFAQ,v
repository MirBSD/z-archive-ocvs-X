  This is a FreeType/2 programmers' mini-FAQ

Q1: Is the source code available?

A1: Yes! But if you think you have all you need, you're probably wrong :-)
   The source is now actually part of FreeType project, located at
      ftp://ftp.physiol.med.tu-muenchen.de/pub/freetype

   We have now the permission to distribute the OS/2 IFI headers with
   the FreeType/2 source code. They're all the files beginning with a
   "32" in the "ifi" directory. It seems that some people had problems
   with the download indicated in the last beta.


Q2: What compilers are supported?

A2: The development of FreeType/2 was done primarily in IBM's VisualAge C++
   version 3.0. It should be possible to build the DLL with Watcom C/C++ but
   it's not quite working yet.
    It is perhaps possible to build the Font Driver with another compiler,
   but you'll have to know the compiler (and OS/2 of course) _quite_ well.

    Note that the FreeType library itself supports also EMX/GCC (and I
    believe it was mainly developed in it).


Q3: What other tools do I need?

A3: You'll need a kernel debugger. Check out IBM's ICAT, it's great and
   it's free! Actually without ICAT this code would probably never happen.
    If you've lived under a rock and don't know what ICAT is, it's actually
   an interface to ol' good KDB. It is a source-level debugger and it looks
   and feels very much like the VisualAge debugger, IPMD.

    And if you haven't got it yet, you'll need _two_ computers to use ICAT.
   But believe me, it's worth it!

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

This is version 2.7 of a program to convert TrueType fonts to BDF fonts using
the FreeType renderer.

BDF fonts can be edited using the XmBDFEditor which is available from (replace
the <version> with the most current version number):

COMPILING ttf2bdf
-----------------

1. Pick up the latest FreeType distribution from:

ftp://ftp.physiol.med.tu-muenchen.de/pub/freetype/devel/freetype-current.tar.gz

2. Unpack FreeType and build it.

3. Go into the "contrib/ttf2bdf/" directory and type "make" to build "ttf2bdf".

RUNNING ttf2bdf
---------------

Type the following to get a list of command line options:

  % ttf2bdf -h

  length of _XFREE86_GLYPH_RANGES properties and an Exceed font compiler.

CHANGES
-------
Version 2.7
===========
  1. Swapped all the columns in the mapping files.

  2. Changed the mapping table loader to index on the second column instead of
     the first.

  3. Reduced the line length of _XFREE86_GLYPH_RANGES properties to 256
     instead of 512.

Version 2.6
===========
  1. Changed the includes to deal with compilation on Windows.

  2. Added some new mapping tables.

Version 2.5
===========
  1. Updated the copyright dates.

  2. Fixed an incorrect parameter for Traditional C compilers.

  3. Added generation of the _XFREE86_GLYPH_RANGES properties.

Version 2.4
===========
  1. Change all CRLF's, CR's, or LF's in copyright strings to double spaces.

  2. Changed it so gcc 2.8.1 likes the return type of main() again.

Version 2.3
===========
  1. Changed Makefile.in a bit to make installation more consistent.

  2. Changed the lower limit for the vertical and horizontal resolutions to be
     10dpi instead of 50dpi.

Version 2.2
===========
  1. Added missing documentation in the manual page.

  2. Added the `-u' parameter to allow setting the character used to replace
     dashes or spaces in the font name.

  3. Changed the CHARSET_REGISTRY and CHARSET_ENCODING to be "ISO10646-1"
     instead of "Unicode-2.0".

  4. The numGlyphs property comes back incorrect for some fonts, so the loop
     cycles through all 65536 possibilities every time now.

Version 2.1
===========
  1. Added patches provided by Bertrand Petit.

  2. Insured compatibility with FreeType 1.1.

Version 2.0
===========
  1. Created two new subdirectories.  One for mapping tables and one for any
     other contributed code, scripts, or data.

  2. Updated Cyrillic mapping files sent by Eugene Bobin.

  3. Minor fixes to make compatible with the latest version of FreeType.

Version 1.9
===========
  1. Fixed a problem with the first code of a mapping table being lost.

Version 1.8
===========
  1. Added the Unicode->Cyrillic mapping tables provided by Eugene Bobin.

  2. Created a shell script based on Eugene Bobin's scripts to generate sets
     of BDF fonts at one time.

Version 1.7
===========
  1. If a remapping table is provided, code ranges are now expected to be
     specified in terms of the codes in the mapping table.

  2. The glyph generation loop is improved a bit.

Version 1.6
===========
  1. Added two expected keywords REGISTRY and ENCODING in the remap files.
     These values are used when the font's XLFD name is generated.

  2. Added TTF2BDF_VERSION macro used for adding the "Converted by" comment.

  3. Handle the case of no glyphs being generated.  No BDF font is produced.

  4. Updated for new API with TT_Engine.

Version 1.5
===========
  1. Fixed a problem with updating the average width field of the XLFD
     font name.

  2. Changed things so bitmaps are generated to a temporay file so an
     accurate count and metrics can be calculated.

  3. Changed things so the font header is not generated until the bitmaps
     have been generated.  This allows accurate calculations of the various
     fields needed.

  4. Added the '-l' command line parameter that allows specification of a
     subrange of glyphs to generate.  The syntax is the same as that used in
     X11 for subranges.  See the X11 XLFD documentation, page 9 for more
     detail.

     Example:

       % ttf2bdf -l '60 70 80_90' font.ttf -o font.bdf

       The command above will only generate the glyphs for codes 60, 70,
       and 80 through 90 inclusive.

  5. Added the ability to load a mapping table that will remap a font to
     another character set.  The mapping table should have two columns.

     The first column should be the hexadecimal code of the glyph in the
     "cmap" table ttf2bdf is using.  The second column should have the
     code which should be used in the BDF font.  An example mapping file
     is provided which will map fonts from Unicode (default cmap table) to
     ISO8859-2.

  6. Fixed grid fitting to avoid dropout in some cases.

  7. Removed dependency on ttobjs.h by using the new API function for
     retrieving strings.

  8. Removed warning about getpid() on Solaris.

  9. Rearranged the man page a bit to be more useful.  Minor
     improvements also done.

  10. Changed the loop so it does not include 0xffff as a code because
      it causes crashes when converting some fonts.

Version 1.4 [Never released as binaries]
===========
  1. Changed the names of two MS encodings (Wansung and Johab) to
     KSC5601.1987 and KSC5601.1992.

  2. Added the '-n' command line flag to turn hinting off.

  3. Added the '-c' command line flag to set the font spacing.

  4. Added the '-t', '-w', and '-s' command line options to override the
     default typeface, weight and slant names.

Version 1.3
===========
  1. Converted to use the new FreeType API.

  2. Added the '-rh' and '-rv' command line parameters to allow both the
     horizontal and vertical resolutions to be set individually.

  3. Fixed a problem with ignoring undefined glyphs.  All undefined were
     being rendered which caused missing glyphs on the end.

  4. Fixed a problem with offset calculations needed to render glyph
     bitmaps.

Version 1.2
===========
  1. Fixed a problem with dashes that appear in the font family name causing
     parse problems with the XLFD font names.

  2. Fixed a problem with certain bitmaps missing their final byte on each
     row.

  3. Fixed an incorrect FONT_DESCENT value.

  4. Changed things around so names can be retrieved in a more general way.

  5. Fixed a problem with bitmaps not being generated after a certain point.

Version 1.1
===========
  1. Fixed the actual glyph count for the CHARS line.

  2. Swapped the Big5 and GB2312 XLFD encoding strings because of incorrect TT
     specifications.

  3. Fixed a problem with bitmap generation for glyphs that are width 1 or
     height 1.

  4. Added command line parameters to set the font and render pool memory
     sizes in Kilobytes from the command line.

Version 1.0
===========
  1. Initial release.

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

.TH TTF2BDF 1 "21 October 1999" "X Version 11"
.SH NAME 
ttf2bdf \- TrueType to BDF font converter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ttf2bdf
[\fIoptions\fP] [\fIfont.ttf\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I ttf2bdf
will convert a TrueType font to a BDF font using the FreeType renderer.

.SH OPTIONS
.I ttf2bdf
accepts the following command line arguments:

.PP
.TP 8
.I -v
print warning messages when the font is converted.
.PP
.TP 8
.I -p n
set the desired point size (see default value by running the program with the
-h option).
.PP
.TP 8
.I -r n
set both the horizontal and the vertical resolution (see default value by
running the program with the -h option).  The minimum is 10dpi and the maximum
is 1200dpi.
.PP
.TP 8
.I -rh n
set the horizontal resolution (see default value by running the program with
the -h option).  The minimum is 10dpi and the maximum is 1200dpi.
.PP
.TP 8
.I -rv n
set the vertical resolution (see default value by running the program with
the -h option).  The minimum is 10dpi and the maximum is 1200dpi.
.PP
.TP 8
.I -o outfile
sets the output filename (default output is to stdout).
.PP
.TP 8
.I -pid id
set the platform id for selecting the character map (see default value by
running the program with the -h option).
.PP
.TP 8
.I -eid id
set the encoding id for selecting the character map (see default value by
running the program with the -h option).
.PP
.TP 8
.I -c c
set the character spacing.  This should be one of `P' for proportional,
`M' for monospace, or `C' for character cell.  By default, the spacing
of a font will be automatically determined to be either `M' or `P'
according to values provided in the font.
.PP
.TP 8
.I -f name
set the foundry name used in the XLFD name.  The default value is
`Freetype'.
.PP
.TP 8
.I -t name
set the typeface name used in the XLFD name.  By default,
.I ttf2bdf
will attempt to get a name from the font first and then it will use the
name supplied with this command line option, and if all else fails, it
will use the name `Unknown'.
.PP
.TP 8
.I -w name
set the weight name used in the XLFD name.  If this value is not
supplied, the default value is assumed to be `Medium'.  Some common
values for this are `Thin', `Delicate', `ExtraLight', `Light', `Normal',
`Medium', `SemiCondensed', `Condensed', `SemiBold', `Bold', `Heavy',
`ExtraBold', and `ExtraHeavy'.
.PP
.TP 8
.I -s name
set the slant name used in the XLFD name.  If this value is not
supplied, the default value is assumed to be `R', for Roman.  Some common
values for this are `R' for Roman, `I' for Italic, `O' for Oblique, `RI'
for Reverse Italic, and `RO' for Reverse Oblique.
.PP
.TP 8
.I -k name
set the width name used in the XLFD name.  The default is `Normal'.
.PP
.TP 8
.I -d name
set the additional style name used in the XLFD name.  The default is an empty
string.
.PP
.TP 8
.I -u char
set the character used to replace the dashes/spaces in a font name.  The
default is the space character.
.PP
.TP 8
.I -l subset
define a list of character codes which will be used to select a subset
of glyphs from the font.  The syntax of the subset string is the same
as the syntax for selecting subsets in X11 XLFD font names.  Example:
.sp
% ttf2bdf -l '60 70 80_90' font.ttf -o font.bdf
.sp
The command above will only generate the glyphs for codes 60, 70, and 80
through 90 inclusive.  Glyphs that are not in the subset are not
generated.
.PP
.TP 8
.I -m mapfile
specifies a mapping file which will reencode the BDF font when it is
generated.  Any glyphs with codes that do not have a mapping will not
be generated.
.sp
The remapping file should begin with two lines, one which starts with
REGISTRY followed by the character set registry and one which starts
with ENCODING followed by the encoding.  An example from the
iso8859.2 file:
.sp
REGISTRY ISO8859
.br
ENCODING 2
.sp
The remapping data should be two columns of hexadecimal numbers, separated by
spaces or tabs.  The first column should have the code which should be used in
the BDF font.  The second column should be the hexadecimal code of the glyph
in the "cmap" table ttf2bdf is using.  An example mapping file is provided
which will map fonts from Unicode (the default "cmap" table) to ISO8859-2.
.sp
Unicode is not the only option.  If you choose another platform and
encoding ID on the command line, then the remapping is assumed to map
from the chosen platform and encoding to some other character set.

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

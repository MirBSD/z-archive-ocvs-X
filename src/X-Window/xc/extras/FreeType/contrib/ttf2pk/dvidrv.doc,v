@Using dvidrv.btm [emTeX for DOS and OS/2]
-------------------------------------------

This batch file does the same as MakeTeXPK does; it is a replacement for
dvidrv.exe of emTeX which can handle ttf2pk, hbf2gf, and ps2pk additionally
(the ps2pk part is untested yet; it uses ps2pkmfj of the 4allTeX
distribution and was basically copied from a similar script, also part of
4allTeX).

First of all, create and install a set of TFM files as described in the
previous section.

Then configure the following variables in dvidrv.btm:

    ps2pk       ... set it to `yes' if you want to use this program
    ttf2pk      ... ditto
    hbf2gf      ... ditto

    pkdir       ... the place where PK files created by ps2pk, ttf2pk,
                    or hbf2gf should go to. dvidrv.btm adds
                    `\modeless\XXXdpi' resp. `\modeless\dpiXXX' to this
                    string (depending on the variables `pre_dpi' and
                    `post_dpi')

    ttfonts     ... where the TrueType fonts files reside
    ttfcfg      ... where the auxiliary data files of ttf2pk reside

    hbfonts     ... where the HBF files reside
    hbfcfg      ... the place where the hbf2gf configuration files are

The last four variables in the above list support trailing `!' and `!!' for
recursive directory searching (see the dvidrv.doc of the emTeX package for
details).

Alternatively, you can set these variables in the environment; please note
that no spaces are allowed before and after the equal sign, e.g.

  set foo=bar

is OK, but

  set foo = bar

will fail.

Rename dvidrv.exe to dvidrv.ori or something similar and copy dvidrv.btm to
a directory in the path.

Don't forget to update the DVIDRVFONTS and TEXTFM environment variables if
necessary.

Under OS/2 dvips will call mfjob or hbf2gf itself; under DOS it will create
a batch file which must be called afterwards.

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

---------------------------------
  After X-TT Project
---------------------------------

* Changes from 1.4.2rc1 to 1.4.2
  - Added minor improvements.

* Changes from 1.4.1 to 1.4.2rc1
  - Fixed several bugs of make_up_italic_bitmap() function.
  - Changed the order of priority of mapIDRelations in JISX0208 and JISX0201
    code converter. The windows ucs2 is given the highest priority for kochi-substitute
    Japanese fonts.
  - Fixed code relation in cc_jisx0208_to_std_ucs2() function.
    (not 0x215d -> 0x00b1 but 0x215d -> 0x2212)
  - Added minor improvements.

* Changes from 1.4.1rc1 to 1.4.1
  - Added minor improvements.

* Changes from 1.4.0 to 1.4.1rc1
  - Fixed an X server crash because of an inconsistency problem between XFree86
    and X-TT(reported by Koike Kazuhiko).
  - Improved fix to prevent NULL dereference when the font cache becomes full;
    solution by allocation of a dummy area for bitmap.

* Changes from 1.4.0rc1 to 1.4.0
  - Fixed an X server crash when using LucidaSansRegular.ttf
    (reported by Koike Kazuhiko).
  - Added U+20AC and U+00AE characters to KSCJOHABtoUCS2.c and 
    KSC5601toUCS2.c(Jungshik Shin).
  - Added ksc5601.*-3 and ksx1001.*-3 to KSCJOHAB/main.c(Jungshik Shin).

* Changes from 1.4.0beta1 to 1.4.0rc1
  - Improved fix for server crash that appears on Linux/PPC.
  - Support for reverse `fc' specification. `fc=0xaa00-0xa0ff' means
    specifying the ranges 0x0000-0xa0ff and 0xaa00-0xffff. This is 
    useful for GB18030 proportional fonts.
  - Preparation for extending the encoding field of XLFD. The X-TT permits the
    following additional XLFD format:
    "-foo-foo-medium-r-normal--0-0-0-0-c-0-foo.2000-0.0"
    "-foo-foo-medium-r-normal--0-0-0-0-c-0-foo.2000-0.1"
    The last number can be used to indicate the plane number of a huge character set.
  - Added patch for mktcapdir-0.5.4 and some ttfconf files suitable for X-TT
    1.4.0.
  - Other minor improvements.

* Changes from 1.3.0 on XF86-4.3.0 to 1.4.0beta1
  - Improved fix to crashs caused when certain fonts (e.g. verdana.ttf)
    are used; solution based on investigating the true nature of the problem.
  - Improved performance based on the solution to the buffer overflow problem,
    caused by exceeding the range of maxbounds.ascent/maxbounds.descent. 
    This problem occurred only when `-m-' spacing was used.
  - Performance improvement of FreeTypeGetMetrics() function.
  - New options for TTCap, `fc' and `fm': they enable the *extremely*
    fast loading of big Japanese or unicode fonts with `-p-' in the
    XLFD.
  - Enhancements for `ds', `eb' and `bw' options.
  - Using Embedded Bitmap with the option `eb=y' when Auto Italic is set.
  - Trying to use TT_Load_Glyph_Bitmap() in get_metrics() when `bs'
    option is not set.
  - Extension of code converter modules for ARABIC, ARMSCII8,
    BIG5HKSCS, GB18030, ISO8859.*, etc. (Pablo Saratxaga, James Su)
  - Some other minor improvements.

* Changes from 1.3.0 to 1.3.0 on XF86-4.3.0
  - Fixed an X server crash that appears on Linux/PPC, related to 
    invalid code converter module being loaded because of a broken
    string comparison in xttcconv.c (Chisato Yamauchi, Daisuke 
    MASATSUNA).
  - Fixed an X server crash caused by a NULL dereference when the font
    cache becomes full (Chisato Yamauchi, tokeijikakenoringo).
  - Increased the default font cache size so that it works better for
    iso10646 (Hidetoshi Yamano-uchi, Chisato Yamauchi).
  - Fixed an X-TT garbage-display problem when glyphs are
    undefined for fixed width fonts (Hidetoshi Yamano-uchi,
    Chisato Yamauchi).
  - Fixed an X server crash caused by returning a NULL pointer for the
    bitmap, even when the height was non-zero. The problem occurred
    when using some specific fonts (eg. verdana.ttf) and loading huge
    fonts. (Chisato Yamauchi).
  - Fixed an X server crash caused by buffer overflow. The problem was
    caused by glyph ascent/descent exceeding the range of 
    maxbounds.ascent/maxbounds.descent (Chisato Yamauchi, Masanori
    Shimada).

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time

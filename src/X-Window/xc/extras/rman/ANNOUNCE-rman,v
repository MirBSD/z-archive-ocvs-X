@======================================================================

PolyglotMan (nee RosettaMan) is a filter for UNIX manual pages.  It
takes as input man pages for a variety of UNIX flavors and produces as
output a variety of file formats.  Currently PolyglotMan accepts man
pages from the following flavors of UNIX: Hewlett-Packard HP-UX, AT&T
System V, SunOS, Sun Solaris, OSF/1, DEC Ultrix, SGI IRIX, Linux, SCO,
FreeBSD; and produces output for the following formats: printable
ASCII only (stripping page headers and footers), section and
subsection headers only, TkMan, [tn]roff, RTF, SGML (soon--I finally
found a DTD), HTML, MIME, LaTeX, LaTeX 2e, Perl 5's pod.  Previously
<I>PolyglotMan</I> required pages to be formatted by nroff prior to
its processing; with version 3.0, it prefers [tn]roff source and
usually can produce results that are better yet.

PolyglotMan improves upon other man page filters in several ways: (1) its
analysis recognizes the structural pieces of man pages, enabling high
quality output, (2) its modular structure permits easy augmentation of
output formats, (3) it accepts man pages formatted with the variant
macros of many different flavors of UNIX, and (4) it doesn't require
modification of or cooperation with any other program.

PolyglotMan is a rewrite of TkMan's man page filter, called bs2tk.  (If
you haven't heard about TkMan, a hypertext man page browser, you
should grab it via anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.berkeley.edu:
/ucb/people/phelps/tkman.tar.Z.)  Whereas bs2tk generated output only for
TkMan, PolyglotMan generalizes the process so that the analysis can be
leveraged to new output formats.  A single analysis engine recognizes
section heads, subsection heads, body text, lists, references to other
man pages, boldface, italics, bold italics, special characters (like
bullets), tables (to a degree) and strips out page headers and
footers.  The engine sends signals to the selected output functions so
that an enhancement in the engine improves the quality of output of
all of them.  Output format functions are easy to add, and thus far
average about about 75 lines of C code each.

A note for HTML consumers:  This filter does real (heuristic) parsing--
no <PRE>!  Man page references are turned into hypertext links.  The files 
<URL:ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/people/phelps/tcltk/sgi-ls.1.html>
and <URL:ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/people/phelps/tcltk/ksh.1.html>
are examples of the quality of output produced entirely automatically
(no retouching) by PolyglotMan.  These translations were produced by
PolyglotMan starting with the [tn]roff source (again no retouching).
Several people have extended World Wide Web servers to format man pages 
on the fly.  Check the README file in the contrib directory for a list.


CHANGES in 3.0

* [tn]roff source preferred for superior results, when roff macros are
  sufficiently recognized.  Autodetection of source or formatted input.
* New software license that makes it free for any use


CHANGES in 2.5

* SGML output format that adheres to Davenport DocBook v2.3 DTD
  (NOT READY IN CURRENT VERSION!)
* MIME output format, for e-mail and Emacs 19.29's enriched mode
  (Neal Becker)
* port to Macintosh by Matthias Neeracher
* list of valid volume names can be given as a parameter (Dag Nygren)
* updated to LaTeX2e (H. Palme)
* debugging scaffolding erected (at the end of software's development cycle!)


CHANGES in 2.2

* when in SEE ALSO, hyphens would confuse man page-reference finder, 
  so re-linebreak if necessary to eliminate them (!) (Greg Earle & Uri Guttman)


CHANGES in 2.1

* gets() replaced by custom code.  gets() deprecated since it reads until \0, 
  introducing security problems. (Robert Withrow)

* TkMan module revised for Tk 4.0

1.1.9.1

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-
# butor be held liable for any damage, directly or indirectly, that origina-
# ted through or is caused by creation or modification of this work.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

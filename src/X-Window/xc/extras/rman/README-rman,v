@*** INSTALLING ***

Set BINDIR in the Makefile to where you keep your binaries and MANDIR
to where you keep your man pages (in their source form).  (If you're
using PolyglotMan with TkMan, BINDIR needs to be a component of your
bin PATH.)  After properly editing the Makefile, type `make install'.
Thereafter (perhaps after a `rehash') type `rman' to invoke PolyglotMan.
PolyglotMan requires an ANSI C compiler.  To compile on a Macintosh
under MPW, use Makefile.mac.

If you send me bug reports and/or suggestions for new features,
include the version of PolyglotMan (available by typing `rman -v').
PolyglotMan doesn't parse every aspect of every man page perfectly, but
if it blows up spectacularly where it doesn't seem like it should, you
can send me the man page (or a representative man page if it blows up
on a class of man pages) in BOTH: (1) [tn]roff source form, from
.../man/manX and (2) formatted form (as formatted by `nroff -man'),
uuencoded to preserve the control characters, from .../man/catX.

The home location for PolyglotMan is ftp.cs.berkeley.edu:
/ucb/people/phelps/tcltk/rman.tar.Z (this is a softlink to the latest,
numbered version).  If you discover a bug and you obtained PolyglotMan
at some other site, first grab it from this one to see if the problem
has been fixed.

Be sure to look in the contrib directory for WWW server interfaces,
a batch converter, and a wrapper for SCO.

--------------------------------------------------

*** NOTES ON CURRENT VERSION ***

Help!  I'm looking for people to help with the following projects.
(1) Better RTF output format.  The current one works, but could be
made better.  (2) Extending the macro sets for source recognition.  If
you write an output format or otherwise improve PolyglotMan, please
send in your code so that I may share the wealth in future releases.
(3) Fixing output for various (accented?) characters in the Latin1
character set.

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@/* $Id: http-rman.c,v 1.1 2003/03/22 20:01:47 tg Exp $
 *
 * Name:
 *	http-rman.c -- a rudimentary man-page HTTP server
 *
 * Description:
 *	This is a minimal HTTP server using RosettaMan by T.A. Phelps
 *	(phelps@@ACM.org) to produce hypertext renditions
 *	of man-pages on the fly.
 *
 *	This server processes URLs with the following syntax:
 *
 *		[/man] ?<command> [ ?<section> ]
 *
 *	For URLs matching this format, it pipes the output of
 *	man <section> <command> through rman and sends it to
 *	the HTTP client. For other URLs, it returns the document
 *	given as argv[1] (using cat(1). The leading /man is
 *	optional, but is strongly recommended.
 *
 *	This server is shipped as two files, the http-rman.c
 *	sources and the http-rman.html sample frontpage. I have
 *	not included a Makefile; you can write your own or just
 *	type [g]cc -o http-rman http-rman.c
 *
 * What do I need to run this:
 *	If you don't have it, pick up RosettaMan by anonymous ftp
 *	from ftp.cs.berkeley.edu: /ucb/people/phelps/tcl/rman.tar.Z
 *
 *	You'll also need an HTTP client such as NCSA Mosaic to talk
 *	to this server. Mosaic is available by anonymous FTP from
 *	ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Mosaic 
 *
 *	Both RosettaMan (rman) and Mosaic are available from many
 *	other sites. Try Archie, or check your local or national net
 *	archive.
 *
 * How do I get it running:
 *	First, compile the server (see above), and install it
 *	somewhere.
 *
 *	The server runs under inetd(8). Add a service to
 *	/etc/services, say:
 *
 *		http-rman 4080/tcp
 *
 *	If you're not about to install another HTTP server on your
 *	machine, you may use the default HTTP port, 80, instead.
 *
 *	Then add an entry to /etc/inetd.conf, such as (on a single line):
 *
 *		http-rman stream tcp nowait root /usr/local/bin/http-rman
 *			http-rman /usr/local/lib/rman/http-rman.html
 *
 *	Change /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/lib/rman to where you
 *	installed the two files. In addition, you may wish to run
 *	the server as something other than root...
 *
 *	Restart inetd(8) (use kill -HUP or kill it and start it again)
 *	and try the following:
 *
 *	$ Mosaic http://localhost:4080
 *
 *	If you don't have Mosaic, try the following instead:
 *
 *	$ telnet localhost 4080
 *	Trying 127.0.0.1...
 *	Connected to localhost.
 *	Escape character is '^]'.
 *	GET /man?ls <return>
 *	<return>
 *	HTTP/1.0 200 OK
 *	...
 *
 * Portability:
 *	You'll need an ANSI compiler (or an editor and some patience).
 *	As it stands right now, this code has been successfully
 *	compiled on OSF/1 AXP using cc, and on SunOS 4.1 using gcc.
 *	Might need some tuning for other platforms.
 *
 * Legal Issues:
 *	Check the external visibility of the http-rman service
 *	you choose. This server gives a user access to ALL man-
 *	pages on your machine. You may have installed copyrighted
 *	software (your operating system, for example) with
 *	man-pages that you are NOT allowed to make visible for
 *	anyone out there...
 *
 * History:
 *	94-04-30 fl: created
 *	94-05-13 fl: stripped away everything but rman support

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

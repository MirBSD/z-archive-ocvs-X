@remove a bunch of files not used in MirBSD - clean tree. People who want them got cvs.
@
text
@This directory contains files contributed by PolyglotMan users.  These
files are not installed, supported or regularly updated to work with
new versions of PolyglotMan.  They are included because some may find
them useful, and if so they prevent duplication of effort.

--

* sutter.txt - "Edward L. Sutter" <els@@sage.sage.att.com>

"...converting "man" directories with their typical sub-directories of
man1, man2, etc... to an equivalently structured "html" directory with
the same sub-directory heirarchy."

"I added an option to rman that allows it to search for the files over
a specified set of directories.  This allows (for example) manpages under
man1 that reference something under man3 to be properly linked."

--

* bennett.txt - Anne Bennett <anne@@alcor.concordia.ca>

"... I applied the mods in contrib/sutter.txt, and then amplified
them.  I append the relevant context diffs.  In short, I added options
"-P" (a URL prefix for use with the paths found by "-S"), and "-H" and
"-F" (header and footer HTML files to help adjust the style of the
resulting page, for example by adding company logos,
return-to-home-page buttons, etc.)."

--

* authried.txt -  Erwin Authried <eauth@@mail4u.atnet.at>

"I wrote a small perl script (it's a quick hack) to view man-pages
with the web-browser."

--

* gzip.patch - Todd Larason <jtl@@molehill.org>

"I keep several manpage hierarchies locally, for easy comparison when
programming for multiple unix machines, most of which are across a
relatively slow link.  To save disk space, I keep them gzipped.

"Here's a small patch to make .so handling work against gzipped files.
It's a late-night-after-a-long-day hack, but it seems clean enough.  If
you think there might be any interest, feel free to include it either in
rman itself or the contrib directory.  It's against 3.0a3."

--

* man2html - Marc Donner (donner@@fid.morgan.com)

A Korn Shell script that is moderately generic.  It takes all the
files in a directory or a set of directories and does them one at a
time, putting the html output somewhere appropriate.  The only
infelicity in the script is the stuff with localeo (local electronic
office) which is a hack put together to tweak the URLs not to refer to
localhost, which is broken right now, but directly to the local
server's alias.

---

* sco-wrapper.sh - Dag Nygren <dag@@newtech.fi>

SCO puts the names of valid man page sections in the file /etc/default/man.
This wrapper extracts the names from this file and passes them on to 
PolyglotMan for use in determining man page cross references.

---

* http-rman.{c,html} - Fredrik Lundh <fredrik@@kalle.teragon.ivab.se>

An HTTP server using PolyglotMan to produce hypertext renditions of
man-pages on the fly.

---

* lewis.pl - Herb Lewis <herb@@chomps.engr.sgi.com>

CGI bin script written in Perl.

---

* hman.{cgi,ksh,pl} by teto@@geocities.com
A more recent version may be available at http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lakes/8777/hman.html

    hman.cgi		An example of a cgi-bin wrapper to launch hman.pl
			Ideally, all customization should occur here
    hman.ksh		A stand-alone (non-browser) version of hman.cgi
    hman.pl		The core of the PolyglotMan front-end

"I've written a man to html front-end that appears to have unique features:
A second attempt to locate related man pages is made if the original
inquiry fails

"Since PolyglotMan can filter nroff's output or can work with raw
nroff files, this viewer allows selection of the actual man page
file.  Thus either raw or cooked man pages can be selected directly.

"The program is basic perl, but the implementation allows all customization
to be embodied in enviroment variables that should be set in a cgi-bin
wrapper."

--

* youki.pl - Youki Kadobayashi <youki@@center.osaka-u.ac.jp>

CGI bin script written in Perl 5, and using CGI.pm
and thus "it can be accelerated with mod_perl".

---

rman_html_split - Robert Moniot <moniot@@fordham.edu>
rman_html_split.1

Breaks up rman HTML output in file (or standard input) into separate
section files, placing them into a directory.  With manual page.

---

Other converters are not included in this directory, but rather are
available over the net:

* bsdi-man.pl - Fritz Heinrichmeyer

Available at:  http://ES-sun2.fernuni-hagen.de


* bbc_man2html - Brooks Cutter (brooks@@paradyne.com)

Available at:  http://www.stuff.com/~bcutter/home/programs/bbc_man2html.html


* rman.pl - Alex Gagin

Available at: http://www.jinr.dubna.su/~gagin/rman.pl.html

(Be aware that the communications link is slow.)


* manner.pl - Ray W. Hiltbrand

Available at:  ftp://ftp.eng.auburn.edu/pub/rayh/man2html/manner.pl

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

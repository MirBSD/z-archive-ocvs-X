@.TH rman_html_split 1 "4 Aug 1998"
.SH NAME
rman_html_split \-  split rman html output into separate sections
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rman_html_split
[
.I options
] [
.I file
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBrman_html_split\fP script reads a file containing HTML produced
from a manual page by the \fBrman\fP(1) program, and splits it into a
set of files, each containing one section or subsection of the manual.
Each section file has added to it an optional header identifying the
program described by the manual page, a link to the table of contents,
and links to the previous section and the next section.  The separate
section files are placed in a subdirectory.  A symbolic link named
\fIindex.\|html\fP is created in this subdirectory, linked to either
\fIsect0.\|html\fP (the first section) or \fItoc.\|html\fP (the table
of contents section).
.PP
Use this script to split a large manual page into smaller, more
manageable parts for use as online web-based documentation.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR  "\-d \fIdir\fP" " | "  "\-\-html\-dir \fIdir\fP"
Place output into directory \fIdir\fP.  The default directory name is
\fIhtml\fP.
.TP
.BR "\-m \fInum\fP" " | "  "\-\-merge \fInum\fP"
Merge sections 0 thru \fInum\fP into one file.  The default for
\fInum\fP is 1, since usually section 0 is the NAME section and
section 1 is SYNOPSIS, which are usually both short and go well
together.  Set
.I num
to 0 to prevent merging, or set it to a larger number to merge more
initial sections.  Maximum value of \fInum\fP is 9. There is no
provision for merging sections other than consecutive numbers from
section 0.
.TP
.BR \-t " | "  \-\-toc\-first
Link \fIindex.\|html\fP to the table of contents.  By default, it is
linked to \fIsect0.\|html\fP.  Use this if you prefer the initial page
to be the table of contents rather than the first section of the
manual page.
.TP
.BR "\-T \fItitle\fP" " | "  "\-\-title \fItitle\fP"
Use \fItitle\fP as a header on top of each page.  This header is
displayed using the H2 HTML tag.  By default, \fBrman_html_split\fP uses
the title generated by \fBrman\fP.  By making \fItitle\fP the empty
string (""), the header can be suppressed entirely.
.TP
.BR \-h " | "  \-\-help
Print synopsis and exit.
.TP
.BR \-V " | "  \-\-version
Print version information and exit.
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR man (1),
.BR rman (1).
.SH BUGS

1.1.9.1

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@remove a bunch of files not used in MirBSD - clean tree. People who want them got cvs.
@
text
@1993
 1 Apr	as bs2tk posted to comp.lang.tcl (126 lines)
 2	bullets, change bars, copyright symbol
 5	boldface, other SGI nicks
 7	skip unrecognized escape codes
10	small caps
13	underscores considered uppercase so show up in default small caps font
	screen out Ultrix junk (code getting pretty tangled now)
14	until Tk text has better tab support, replace tabs by spaces until get to next tab stop (for Ultrix); -t gives tabstop spacing
20	Solaris support (Larry Tsui)
 3 Jun	section subheading parsing (Per-Erik Martin)
28	hyphenated man pages in SEE ALSO show up correctly in Links (Mike Steele)
13 Jul	under FILES, fully qualified path names are added to Links, but this taken out immediately because not useful
14	option to keep changebars on right (Warren Jessop)
 5 Aug	search for header, footer dynamically--no need to edit or search large list of patterns
11	-m kicks in man page formatting beyond nroff backspace kludges
27	handle double digit numbers better by trying again relative to end of line
19 Sep	-T gives Tk extras (otherwise ASCII only)
	-H gives headers only (implies -T off)
10 Oct	-r reverse compiles to [tn]roff source (as Geoff Collyer's nam and fontch, but leveraging existing analysis so only addition of ~60 lines)  (The code is device-driver obscure now--obfuscated C contest next.)
13	header and footer optionally available at bottom in Tk view (Marty Leisner)
19	"reflected" odd and even page headers&footers zapped
20	keep count of sections and subsections, using smaller font for larger numbers
 1 Nov	reverse compiles to Ensemble, except for character ranges
 4	started rman rewrite for cleaner support of multiple output targets, including: plain ascii, headers only, TkMan, [nt]roff, Ensemble, SGML, HTML
 5	line filtering separated from other logic despite greater sophistication, RosettaMan faster than bs2tk (!)
28 Dec	man page reference recognition (Michael Harrison)


1994
 1 Jan	identify descriptive lists by comparing scnt2 with s_avg
 3	tail-end table of contents in HTML documents
 5	-f <filter> and LaTeX output mode
24	proof-of-concept RTF output mode
26	handle man pages that don't have a header on the first page
28	parse "handwritten" man pages
22 Feb	alpha version released
 6 Mar	various bug fixes
10	beta version released
13 Jun	fixed surious generation on <DL>'s (the existence of which pointed out by David Sibley)
22 Jul	table recognition experiment.  works reasonably well, except for tables with centered headers
 3 Aug	allow for off-by-one (and -two) in identification of header and footer
	fixed problem with recurrent/leftover text with OSF/1 bold bullets (yeesh)
12 Sep	2.0gamma released
13	check for *third* header, possibly centered, possibly after blank lines (Charles Anderson)
	fixed tag ranges for lines following blank lines (just \n) of pages with global indentation (Owen Rees)
19	fixed two small problems with LaTeX (^ => \^, \bullet => $\bullet$) (Neal Becker)
24	simple check for erroneously being fed roff source
26	deal with bold +- as in ksh (ugh)
30	2.0delta released
 9 Oct	special check for OSF to guard against section head interpreted as footer
 8 Nov	Perl pod output format (result still needs work, but not much)
 7 Dec	2.0epsilon released (last one before final 2.0)
22	Happy Winter Solstice!  2.0 released
	deprecated gets() replaced (Robert Withrow)
25	TkMan module's $w.show => $t, saving about 9% in generated characters


1995
 1 Jan	experiment with TkMan output to take advantage of my hack to Tk text (i.e., $t insert end "text" => $t insert end "text1" tag1 "text2" tag2 ...); results => output size reduced about 25%, time reduced about 12-15%
25 Mar	back to old mark command for Tk module
8 May	hyphens in SEE ALSO section would confuse link-finder, so re-linebreak if necessary(!) (Greg Earle & Uri Guttman)
 4 Aug	put formats and options into tables (inspired by Steve Maguire's Writing Solid Code)
19	-V accepts colon-separated list of valid volume names (Dag Nygren)
22	MIME output format that's usable in Emacs 19.29 (just three hours at hacking HTML module) (Neal Becker)
 9 Sep	nits in HTML and better Solaris code snippets (Drazen Kacar)
13 Nov	Macintosh port by Matthias Neeracher <neeri@@iis.ee.ethz.ch>
18 Dec	adapted to LaTeX2e, null manRef yields italicized man ref (H. Palme)
28	allow long option names (Larry Schwimmer)


1996
22 Jan	fixed problem with hyphenation supression and tabs in man page--sheesh! (H. Palme)
23 May	split TkMan format into Tk and TkMan (which calls Tk)
25	in TkMan format, initial spaces converted to tabs
24 Sep	experiment with formatting from source's macros, for better transcription short of full nroff interpreter
27	commented out Ensemble output format, which nobody used
 2 Oct	>4000 lines
11
 8 Nov  released 3.0 alpha.  source code parsing works well for Solaris, SunOS, HP-UX; in generating HTML
25	recognize URLs (Mic Campanel)

1997
19 Mar	bug fixes, more special characters (roff expert Larry Jones)
 8 Aug  renamed to PolyglotMan
 4 Nov	TkMan module: Rebus and NoteMark identification for paragraph lengths and command line options taken over from Tcl (still have search, highlight in Tcl, necessarily) (Chad Loder)
	>5000 lines, or nearly 40X the lines of code of version 1.0 (which just supported TkMan)

1998
20 Mar	automatic detection of Tcl/Tk source (within automatic detection of source; already had within formatted)
	centralize casifying SH and SS for formatted and source
	group exception table by category
17 Apr	in source translation, pass along comment lines too
20	incorporate (RCS) versioning diff's, for HTML


Anticipated/Contemplated
make source translation work on Digital UNIX better--just tweaks now
fix up other output formats to work well with source parsing
??-???	SGML/XML output format (DTD found at long last), validated by sgmls/sp

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

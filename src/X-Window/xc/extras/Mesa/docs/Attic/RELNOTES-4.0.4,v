                          Mesa 4.0.4 release notes

                             October 3, 2002

                              PLEASE READ!!!!



Introduction
------------

Mesa uses an even/odd version number scheme like the Linux kernel.
Odd numbered versions (such as 3.3) designate new developmental releases.
Even numbered versions (such as 3.4) designate stable releases.

Mesa 4.0.4 contains bug fixes since version 4.0.3 and a few new extensions
needed for DRI drivers.

See the docs/VERSIONS file for the list of bug fixes.



New Extensions
--------------

GL_NV_texture_rectangle was back-ported from the Mesa 4.1 branch so
that it could be incorporated into the DRI R200 driver.

GL_MESA_ycbcr_texture supports texture images in the YCbCr video format.

GL_APPLE_client_storage extension (for some DRI drivers only) allows the
caller to say that copying the texture image is not needed.

GL_MESA_pack_invert allows glReadPixels and glGetTexImage() to store images
in upside-down order, which better matches conventional image file formats.



Device Drivers
--------------

Mesa advertises itself as either OpenGL 1.2 or OpenGL 1.3 depending on the
device driver.  If the driver enables all the ARB extensions which are part
of OpenGL 1.3 then glGetString(GL_VERSION) will return "1.3".  Otherwise,
it'll return "1.2".

A number of Mesa's software drivers haven't been actively maintained for
some time.  We rely on volunteers to maintain many of the drivers.
Here's the current status of all included drivers:

Driver			Status
----------------------	---------------------
XMesa (Xlib)		implements OpenGL 1.3
OSMesa (off-screen)	implements OpenGL 1.3
FX (3dfx Voodoo1/2)	implements OpenGL 1.3
SVGA			implements OpenGL 1.3
Wind River UGL		implements OpenGL 1.3
Windows/Win32		implements OpenGL 1.3
DOS/DJGPP		implements OpenGL 1.3 (new in Mesa 4.0.2)
GGI			implements OpenGL 1.3
BeOS			needs updating
Allegro			needs updating
D3D			needs updating


The DOS driver has been updated by Daniel Borca for Mesa 4.0.4.

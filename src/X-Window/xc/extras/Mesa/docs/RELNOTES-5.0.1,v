                           Mesa 5.0.1 release notes

                               March 30, 2003



Introduction
------------

Mesa uses an even/odd version number scheme like the Linux kernel.
Even-numbered versions (such as 5.0.x) designate stable releases.
Odd-numbered versions (such as 4.1.x) designate new developmental releases.

Mesa 5.0.1 just fixes bugs found since the 5.0 release.  See the VERSIONS
file for details.


Device Driver Status
--------------------

A number of Mesa's software drivers haven't been actively maintained for
some time.  We rely on volunteers to maintain many of these drivers.
Here's the current status of all included drivers:


Driver			Status
----------------------	---------------------
XMesa (Xlib)		implements OpenGL 1.4
OSMesa (off-screen)	implements OpenGL 1.4
FX (3dfx Voodoo1/2)	implements OpenGL 1.3
SVGA			implements OpenGL 1.3
Wind River UGL		implements OpenGL 1.3
Windows/Win32		implements OpenGL 1.4
DJGPP			implements OpenGL 1.4
GGI			implements OpenGL 1.3
BeOS			implements OpenGL 1.4
Allegro			needs updating
D3D			needs updating

Note: supporting OpenGL 1.4 (vs. 1.3 or 1.2) usually only requires that the
driver call the _mesa_enable_1_4_extensions() function.

@That's what OpenBSD will, probably, ship as XF4 in 3.5
their last sync against XFree86 4.3-current has been
imported into our vendor branch, too

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

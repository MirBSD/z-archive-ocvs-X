@remove a bunch of files not used in MirBSD - clean tree. People who want them got cvs.

NOTE:

These files are incomplete.  They do not yet form a working
implementation of hte concepts discused below.


OVERVIEW

The t_dd_imm_* files form a set of templates to produce driver -
specific software tnl modules for a small subset of transformation and
lighting states.

The approach is quite different to the large vertex buffers of the
src/tnl module, and is based around a cache of four recent vertices
and a 'current' vertex which is updated directly from the Color,
Normal, Texcoord, SecondaryColor and Fog entrypoints.

The current vertex is actually a composite of the ctx->Current values
and a partial hardware vertex maintained where the hardware values
differ from those in ctx->Current.  For example, clamped color values
are kept in the hardware vertex, while texcoords remain in
ctx->Current.

A crude diagram:

       		+--------------+	+-------------------+
		| ctx->Current |	| Current-HW-vertex |
		+--------------+	+-------------------+
		       \       	       	       	  /
		       	\      			 /
			 \     			/
			  \    		       /
			   ---------   --------
			       	   |   |      
			       	   v   v     
	+--------+   +--------+  +--------+  +--------+ 
	| vert-0 |   | vert-1 |  | vert-2 |  | vert-3 |		       	 
	+--------+   +--------+  +--------+  +--------+		       	 
				     |
				     |
				     v
				     
				    DMA


Here values from ctx->Current and current-HW-vertex are merged to
build vert-2, which is then dumped to hardware (DMA).  A state machine
determines which vertex is built in turn, and how the vertices are
used to present primitives to hardware.  These actions all occur
during a call to Vertex{234}f{v}.

Each vert-n includes clip coordinates and a clipmask in addition to
the hardware (window) coordinates.  This information allows clipping
to take place directly on these vertices, if need be.

t_dd_imm_capi.h
	
	Color{34}{fub}{v}() implementations.  These update both
	ctx->Current (unclamped float colors) and current-HW-vertex
	with hardware-specific color values (typically unsigned
	bytes).

	When lighting is enabled, the functions from src/api_noop.c
	should be used, which just update ctx->Current.  (The
	current-hw-vertex colors are produced from lighting, which is
	keyed to Normal3f).

t_dd_imm_vb.c

	Support functions for clipping and fallback.  See
	t_dd_imm_primtmp.h.

t_dd_imm_napi.c
t_dd_imm_napi.h

	Versions of Normal3f{v} to perform lighting with one or more
	infinite lights.  Updates ctx->Current.Normal and the current
	HW colors.

	When lighting is disabled, use the functions from api_noop.c
	instead.


t_dd_imm_primtmp.h

	State machine to control emission of vertices and primitives
	to hardware.  Called indirectly from Vertex{234}f{v}.  Capable
	of supporting hardware strip and fan primitives, and of
	decomposing to discreet primitives for clipping or fallback,
	or where the native primitive is unavailable.

t_dd_imm_tapi.h

	Implementations of TexCoord{v} and MultiTexCoord4f{v}ARB to
	fire a callback when transitioning to projective texture.
	Most drivers will need to change vertex format at this point,
	some may need to enable a software rasterization fallback.

t_dd_imm_vapi.h

	Implementations of Vertex{234}f{v}.  These perform
	transformation and cliptesting on their arguments, then jump
	into the state machine implemented in primtmp.h.

t_dd_imm_vertex.h

	Support functions for building and clip-interpolating hardware
	vertices.  Called from primtmp.h.

1.1.9.1

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@			Fontconfig
	Font configuration and customization library
		      Version 2.2.2
		         2004-3-10

This is the third public release of fontconfig, a font configuration and
customization library.  Fontconfig is designed to locate fonts within the
system and select them according to requirements specified by applications.

Fontconfig is not a rasterization library, nor does it impose a particular
rasterization library on the application.  The X-specific library
'Xft' uses fontconfig along with freetype to specify and rasterize fonts.

Version 2.2.2

Update #includes for newer versions of FreeType

Version 2.2.1

Allows executable names for autotools to be specified in environment
variables.

Close some SGML tags in the documentation.

Fix a catastrophic bug in pattern editing code

Fix a typo "bitsteam" -> "bitstream"

Let FreeType compute slant for type1 fonts instead of poking at the
italic_angle value.

Fix language comparison function.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

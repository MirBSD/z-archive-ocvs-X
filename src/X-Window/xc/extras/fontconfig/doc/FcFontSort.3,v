.SH NAME
FcFontSort \- Return list of matching fonts
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <fontconfig.h>
.sp
FcFontSet * FcFontSort (FcConfig *\fIconfig\fB, FcPattern *\fIp\fB, FcBool\fItrim\fB, FcCharSet **\fIcsp\fB, FcResult *\fIresult\fB);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Returns the list of fonts sorted by closeness to \fIp\fR.  If \fItrim\fR is FcTrue,
elements in the list which don't include Unicode coverage not provided by
earlier elements in the list are elided.  The union of Unicode coverage of
all of the fonts is returned in \fIcsp\fR, if \fIcsp\fR is not NULL.  This function
should be called only after FcConfigSubstitute and FcDefaultSubstitute have
been called for \fIp\fR; otherwise the results will not be correct.
.PP
The returned FcFontSet references FcPattern structures which may be shared
by the return value from multiple FcFontSort calls, applications must not
modify these patterns.  Instead, they should be passed, along with \fIp\fR to
FcFontRenderPrepare which combines them into a complete pattern.
.PP
The FcFontSet returned by FcFontSort is destroyed by caling FcFontSetDestroy.
.SH "VERSION"
.PP
Fontconfig version 2.2.2

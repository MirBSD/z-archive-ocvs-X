Architecture and Users Guide}

\abstract

The Fontconfig library provides for central administration and configuration
of fonts in a POSIX system.  All font consumers can share a common database
of fonts and use common matching rules for font names.  The set of available
fonts can be configured for each user and a set of configurable matching
rules allow for customizing the selection of fonts and configuring various
parameters related to rasterizing of those fonts for display in a variety of
media.  The Fontconfig library is designed to co-exist peacefully with
existing font configuration and rasterization mechanisms; while it uses the
FreeType library to discover characteristics of available fonts, there
is no requirement to use FreeType for rasterization.

@That's what OpenBSD will, probably, ship as XF4 in 3.5
their last sync against XFree86 4.3-current has been
imported into our vendor branch, too

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

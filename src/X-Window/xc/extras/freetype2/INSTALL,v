@In order to build the library, read the `BUILD' document in the `docs'
directory.  This is only a quick starter.


I. From the command line
------------------------

  There  are two ways  to quickly  build FreeType  2 from  the command
  line.

  The first, and favorite one, is to use the "Jam" build tool.  Jam is
  a highly  portable replacement for  Make whose control files  do not
  depend on the current platform or compiler toolset.

  For more information, please see:

    http://www.freetype.org/jam/index.html

  The second one is to use "GNU Make" (and NO OTHER MAKE TOOL).


  1. Building FT2 with "Jam"
  --------------------------

    Once you've  got *our version* of  the Jam tool  installed on your
    system, simply go to the top-level FT2 directory, then type

      "jam"

    on the command line.  This will  build the library and place it in
    the "objs" directory.

    By default,  a static  library is built.   On Unix systems,  it is
    possible to  build a shared library through  the "libtool" script.
    You need to have libtool  installed on your system, then re-define
    a few environment variables before invoking Jam, as in

       export CC="libtool --mode=compile cc"
       export LINK="libtool --mode=link cc"
       jam

    In  later releases  of  FT2, building  shared  libraries with  Jam
    should become automatic.


  2. Building FT2 with "GNU Make"
  -------------------------------

  You need  to have  GNU Make (version  3.78.1 or newer)  installed on
  your system to compile the library from the command line.  This will
  _NOT_ work with other make tools (including BSD make)!

  [Well, this is not  really correct.  Recently, a perl implementation
  of make called `makepp' has appeared which can also build FreeType 2
  successfully on Unix platforms.  See http://LNC.usc.edu/~holt/makepp
  for more details.]

  - Go to the `freetype2' directory.

  - Unix (any C compiler should work):

      - make setup (don't worry, this will invoke a configure script)
      - make
      - make install

    Alternatively,  you can  pass parameters  to the  configure script
    within the CFG variable, as in:

      - make setup CFG="--prefix=/usr"
      - make
      - make install

    If the  configure script isn't run,  try to add `unix' as a target
    on the command line, e.g.:

      - make setup unix CFG="--prefix=/opt/experimental"


  - Windows:

    We provide a  version of GNU Make for Win32  on the FreeType site.
    See http://www.freetype.org/download.html for details.

    - gcc (Mingw, _not_ CygWin):

        - make setup
        - make


    - Visual C++:

        - make setup visualc
        - make


    - other compilers:

        - make setup bcc32    -> Borland C++ 32 bits
        - make setup intelc   -> Intel C++
        - make setup watcom   -> Watcom C++
        - make setup lcc      -> Win32-LCC


II. In your own environment (IDE)
---------------------------------

  You need to add  the directories "freetype2/include" to your include
  path when compiling the library.

  FreeType  2 is  made  of several  components;  each one  of them  is
  located   in  a  subdirectory   of  "freetype2/src".   For  example,
  `freetype2/src/truetype/' contains the TrueType font driver.

  DO NOT COMPILE ALL C FILES!  Rather, compile the following ones:

    -- base components (required)

      src/base/ftsystem.c
      src/base/ftinit.c
      src/base/ftdebug.c
      src/base/ftbase.c
      src/base/ftglyph.c
      src/base/ftbbox.c
      src/base/ftmm.c

      src/base/ftmac.c        -- only on the Macintosh

    -- other components are optional

      src/autohint/autohint.c -- auto hinting module
      src/cache/ftcache.c     -- cache sub-system (in beta)
      src/sfnt/sfnt.c         -- SFNT files support
                                 (TrueType & OpenType)
      src/cff/cff.c           -- CFF/OpenType font driver
      src/psnames/psnames.c   -- Postscript glyph names support
      src/psaux/psaux.c       -- Postscript Type 1 parsing
      src/truetype/truetype.c -- TrueType font driver
      src/type1/type1.c       -- Type 1 font driver
      src/cid/type1cid.c      -- Type 1 CID-keyed font driver
      src/winfonts/winfonts.c -- Windows FONT / FNT font driver

    Note:

       `truetype.c' needs `sfnt.c' and `psnames.c'
       `type1.c'    needs `psaux.c' and `psnames.c'
       `type1cid.c' needs `psaux.c' and `psnames.c'
       `cff.c'      needs `sfnt.c', `psaux.c', and `psnames.c'

       etc.

For more information, please consult "docs/BUILD".

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

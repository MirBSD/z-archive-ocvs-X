@In order to build the library, read the `BUILD' document in the `docs'
directory.  This is only a quick starter.


I. Unix systems
---------------

  If you have GNU Make installed, simply type

    ./configure
    make
    make install

  on the command line to configure, build and install FreeType on your
  system.  Note that the default installation path is "/usr/local".

  Please read the file  README.UNX, it contains _critical_ information
  regarding the installation of FreeType on many Unix systems.


II. From the command line
-------------------------

  If  you are  not using  Unix, there  are two  ways to  quickly build
  FreeType 2 from the command line.

  The first, and favorite one, is to use the "Jam" build tool.  Jam is
  a highly  portable replacement for  Make whose control files  do not
  depend on the current platform or compiler toolset.

  For more information, please see:

    http://www.freetype.org/jam/index.html

  The second one is to use "GNU Make" (and NO OTHER MAKE TOOL).


  1. Building FT2 with "Jam"
  --------------------------

    Once you've  got *our version* of  the Jam tool  installed on your
    system, simply go to the top-level FT2 directory, then type

      "jam"

    on the command line.  This will  build the library and place it in
    the "objs" directory.

    By default,  a static  library is built.   On Unix systems,  it is
    possible to  build a shared library through  the "libtool" script.
    You need to have libtool  installed on your system, then re-define
    a few environment variables before invoking Jam, as in

       export CC="libtool --mode=compile cc"
       export LINK="libtool --mode=link cc"
       jam

    In  later releases  of  FT2, building  shared  libraries with  Jam
    should become automatic on Unix systems.


  2. Building FT2 with "GNU Make"
  -------------------------------

  You need  to have  GNU Make (version  3.78.1 or newer)  installed on
  your system to compile the library from the command line.  This will
  _NOT_ work with other make tools (including BSD make)!

  [Well, this is not  really correct.  Recently, a perl implementation
  of make called `makepp' has appeared which can also build FreeType 2
  successfully on  Unix platforms.   See http://makepp.sourceforge.net
  for more details.]

  - Go to the `freetype2' directory.

  - Unix (any C compiler should work):

      - make setup (don't worry, this will invoke a configure script)
      - make
      - make install

    Alternatively,  you can  pass parameters  to the  configure script
    within the CFG variable, as in:

      - make setup CFG="--prefix=/usr"
      - make
      - make install

    If the  configure script isn't run,  try to add `unix' as a target
    on the command line, e.g.:

      - make setup unix CFG="--prefix=/opt/experimental"


  - Windows:

    We provide a  version of GNU Make for Win32  on the FreeType site.
    See http://www.freetype.org/download.html for details.

    - gcc (Mingw, _not_ CygWin):

        - make setup
        - make


    - Visual C++:

        - make setup visualc
        - make


    - other compilers:

        - make setup bcc32    -> Borland C++ 32 bits
        - make setup intelc   -> Intel C++
        - make setup watcom   -> Watcom C++
        - make setup lcc      -> Win32-LCC


  If you want  to build FreeType 2 in another  directory, you must set
  two environment  variables, `OJB_DIR'  and `TOP'.  The  former gives
  the  directory where  the object  files  and the  library should  be
  created (this directory must exist), the latter the top directory of
  the FreeType 2 source tree.  Example:

    OBJ_DIR=~/freetype2.compiled TOP=~/freetype2 \
      make -f$TOP/Makefile setup ansi
    OBJ_DIR=~/freetype2.compiled TOP=~/freetype2 \
      make -f$TOP/Makefile

  On  Unix boxes,  calling  `configure' from  the  build directory  is
  sufficient;  it  will  build  a  small   Makefile  which  calls  the
  FreeType 2 Makefile with the necessary parameters.


III. In your own environment (IDE)
----------------------------------

  You need to add  the directories "freetype2/include" to your include
  path when compiling the library.

  FreeType  2 is  made  of several  components;  each one  of them  is
  located   in  a  subdirectory   of  "freetype2/src".   For  example,
  `freetype2/src/truetype/' contains the TrueType font driver.

  DO NOT COMPILE ALL C FILES!  Rather, compile the following ones:

    -- base components (required)

      src/base/ftsystem.c
      src/base/ftinit.c
      src/base/ftdebug.c
      src/base/ftbase.c
      src/base/ftglyph.c
      src/base/ftbbox.c
      src/base/ftmm.c

      src/base/ftmac.c        -- only on the Macintosh

    -- other components are optional

      src/autohint/autohint.c -- auto hinting module
      src/cache/ftcache.c     -- cache sub-system (in beta)
      src/sfnt/sfnt.c         -- SFNT files support
                                 (TrueType & OpenType)
      src/cff/cff.c           -- CFF/OpenType font driver
      src/psnames/psnames.c   -- Postscript glyph names support
      src/psaux/psaux.c       -- Postscript Type 1 parsing
      src/truetype/truetype.c -- TrueType font driver
      src/type1/type1.c       -- Type 1 font driver
      src/cid/type1cid.c      -- Type 1 CID-keyed font driver
      src/winfonts/winfonts.c -- Windows FONT / FNT font driver

    Note:

       `truetype.c' needs `sfnt.c' and `psnames.c'
       `type1.c'    needs `psaux.c' and `psnames.c'
       `type1cid.c' needs `psaux.c' and `psnames.c'
       `cff.c'      needs `sfnt.c', `psaux.c', and `psnames.c'

       etc.

For more information, please consult "docs/BUILD".

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

There are several ways to build the FreeType library, depending on your
system and the level of customization you need. Here's a short overview

    Native TrueType hinting is disabled by default[1]. If you really need it,
    read the file "TRUETYPE" for information.

    FreeType 2 on a Unix system. Note that you *will* need GNU Make, since
    other make tools won't work (this includes BSD Make !!)

  3. On VMS with the "mms" build tool:
  
    see INSTALL.VMS for installation instructions on this platform
a19 6
  4. Other systems using GNU Make:
  
    on non-Unix platforms, it's possible to build the library using
    GNU Make utility. Note that *NO OTHER MAKE TOOL WILL WORK* !!
    This methods supports several compilers on Windows, OS/2 and BeOS,
    including Mingw, Visual C++, Borland C++, and more.

    instructions are provided in the file "INSTALL.GNU"

  5. With an IDE Project File  (e.g. for Visual Studio or CodeWarrior):
  
    we provide a small number of "project files" for various IDEs to
    automatically build the library as well. Note that these files are
    not supported and sporadically maintained by FreeType developers,
    so don't expect them to work in each release.
    
    to find them, have a look at the content of the "builds/<system>"
    directory, where <system> stands for your OS or environment.

  6. From you own IDE, or own Makefiles:
  
    If you want to create your own project file, follow the instructions
    given in the "INSTALL.ANY" document of this directory.
d35 1
a36 1
II. Custom builds of the library:

  Customizing the compilation of FreeType is easy, and allows you to select
  only the components of the font engine that you really need. For more details

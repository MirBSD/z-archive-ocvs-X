@Instructions on how to build FreeType with your own build tool:

  see the file "CUSTOMIZE" to learn how to customize FreeType to
  specific environments.

  follow these simple steps:

I. Normal way:
--------------

  * DISABLE PRE-COMPILED HEADERS ! This is very important for Visual
    C++, because FreeType uses lines like:
    
       #include FT_FREETYPE_H
    
    which are not correctly supported by this compiler, while being
    ISO C compliant !!

  * You need to add  the directories "freetype2/include" to your include
    path when compiling the library.

  * FreeType  2 is  made  of several  components;  each one  of them  is
    located   in  a  subdirectory   of  "freetype2/src".   For  example,
    'freetype2/src/truetype/' contains the TrueType font driver.

  * DO NOT COMPILE ALL C FILES!  Rather, compile the following ones:

      -- base components (required)

        src/base/ftsystem.c
        src/base/ftinit.c
        src/base/ftdebug.c
        src/base/ftbase.c
        src/base/ftglyph.c
        src/base/ftbbox.c
        src/base/ftmm.c
        src/base/ftpfr.c        -- optional, see <freetype/ftpfr.h>
        src/base/ftbdf.c        -- optional, see <freetype/ftbdf.h>
        src/base/ftwinfnt.c     -- optional, see <freetype/ftwinfnt.h>

        src/base/ftmac.c        -- only on the Macintosh

     -- other components are optional

        src/autohint/autohint.c -- auto hinting module
        src/cache/ftcache.c     -- cache sub-system (in beta)
        src/sfnt/sfnt.c         -- SFNT files support
                                   (TrueType & OpenType)
        src/cff/cff.c           -- CFF/OpenType font driver
        src/pfr/pfr.c           -- PFR/TrueDoc font driver
        src/bdf/bdf.c           -- BDF font driver
        src/pcf/pcf.c           -- PCF font driver
        src/psnames/psnames.c   -- Postscript glyph names support
        src/psaux/psaux.c       -- Postscript Type 1 parsing
        src/truetype/truetype.c -- TrueType font driver
        src/type1/type1.c       -- Type 1 font driver
        src/cid/type1cid.c      -- Type 1 CID-keyed font driver
        src/winfonts/winfonts.c -- Windows FONT / FNT font driver
        src/raster1/raster1.c   -- monochrome rasterizer
        src/smooth/smooth.c     -- anti-aliasing rasterizer

    Note:

      `truetype.c' needs `sfnt.c' and `psnames.c'
      `type1.c'    needs `psaux.c' and `psnames.c'
      `type1cid.c' needs `psaux.c' and `psnames.c'
      `cff.c'      needs `sfnt.c', `psaux.c', and `psnames.c'

  that should be it ! in case of problems, see the archives of
  the FreeType development mailing list.


II. Support for flat-directory compilation
------------------------------------------

  It is  possible to  put all  FreeType 2 source  files into  a single
  directory, with the *exception* of the `include' hierarchy.

    1. Copy all files in current directory:

        cp freetype2/src/base/*.[hc] .
        cp freetype2/src/raster1/*.[hc] .
        cp freetype2/src/smooth/*.[hc] .
        etc.

    2. Compile sources:

        cc -c -Ifreetype2/include ftsystem.c
        cc -c -Ifreetype2/include ftinit.c
        cc -c -Ifreetype2/include ftdebug.c
        cc -c -Ifreetype2/include ftbase.c
        etc.

   You don't need to define the FT_FLAT_COMPILATION macro (as this was
   required in previous releases of FreeType 2).

@That's what OpenBSD will, probably, ship as XF4 in 3.5
their last sync against XFree86 4.3-current has been
imported into our vendor branch, too

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

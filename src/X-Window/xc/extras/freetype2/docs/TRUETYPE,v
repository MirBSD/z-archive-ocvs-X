@How to enable the TrueType native hinter if you need it
--------------------------------------------------------

  The  TrueType  bytecode  interpreter  is disabled  in  all  public
  releases  of  the  FreeType  packages  for  patents  reasons  (see
  http://www.freetype.org/patents.html for more details).

  However, many Linux distributions do enable the interpreter in the
  FreeType packages (DEB/RPM/etc.) they produce for their platforms.
  If you are using TrueType  fonts on your system, you most probably
  want to enable it manually by doing the following:

    - open the file "include/freetype/config/ftoption.h"

    - locate a line that says:

          #undef TT_CONFIG_OPTION_BYTECODE_INTERPRETER

    - change it to:

          #define TT_CONFIG_OPTION_BYTECODE_INTERPRETER

    of course, this must be done _before_ compiling the library

@That's what OpenBSD will, probably, ship as XF4 in 3.5
their last sync against XFree86 4.3-current has been
imported into our vendor branch, too

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

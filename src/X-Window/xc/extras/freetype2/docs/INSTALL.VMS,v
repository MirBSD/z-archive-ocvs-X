@How to build the freetype2 library on VMS
-----------------------------------------

Just type one of the following depending on the type of external entries you
want:

  mms

or

  mms/macro=("COMP_FLAGS=/name=(as_is,short)")

The library is avalaible in the directory

  [.LIB]

To compile applications using freetype2 you'll need to define the logical
FREETYPE pointing to the directory

  [.INCLUDE.FREETYPE]

(i.e., if the directory in which this README.VMS file is located is
$disk:[freetype] then define the logical with

  define freetype $disk:[freetype.include.freetype]

This version has been tested with Compaq C V6.2-006 on OpenVMS Alpha V7.2-1.


  Any problems can be reported to

@That's what OpenBSD will, probably, ship as XF4 in 3.5
their last sync against XFree86 4.3-current has been
imported into our vendor branch, too

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

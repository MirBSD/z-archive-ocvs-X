# This file is designed for GNU Make, do not use it with another Make tool!
#
# It works as follows:
#
# - When invoked for the first time, this Makefile will include the rules
#   found in `PROJECT/builds/detect.mk'.  They are in charge of detecting
#   the current platform.
#
#   A summary of the detection will be displayed, and the file `config.mk'
#   will be created in the current directory.
#
# - When invoked later, this Makefile will include the rules found in
#   `config.mk'.  This sub-Makefile will define some system-specific
#   variables (like compiler, compilation flags, object suffix, etc.), then
#   include the rules found in `PROJECT/builds/PROJECT.mk', used to build
#   the library.
#
# See the comments in `builds/detect.mk' and `builds/PROJECT.mk' for more
# details on host platform detection and library builds.

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

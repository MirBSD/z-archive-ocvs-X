# FreeType 2 host platform detection rules

# This sub-Makefile is in charge of detecting the current platform.  It sets
# the following variables:
#
#   BUILD        The configuration and system-specific directory.  Usually
#                `freetype/builds/$(PLATFORM)' but can be different for
#                custom builds of the library.
#
# The following variables must be defined in system specific `detect.mk'
# files:
#
#   PLATFORM     The detected platform.  This will default to `ansi' if
#                auto-detection fails.
#   CONFIG_FILE  The configuration sub-makefile to use.  This usually depends
#                on the compiler defined in the `CC' environment variable.
#   DELETE       The shell command used to remove a given file.
#   COPY         The shell command used to copy one file.
#   SEP          The platform-specific directory separator.
#   CC           The compiler to use.
#
# You need to set the following variable(s) before calling it:
#
#   TOP          The top-most directory in the FreeType library source
#                hierarchy.  If not defined, it will default to `.'.

# If TOP is not defined, default it to `.'
#

#   SEP := \
#

1.1.9.1

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

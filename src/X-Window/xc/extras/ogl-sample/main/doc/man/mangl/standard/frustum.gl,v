.SH PARAMETERS
_phead(_param1 _param2)
Specify the coordinates for the left and right vertical clipping planes.
_phead(_param3 _param4)
Specify the coordinates for the bottom and top horizontal clipping planes.
_phead(_param5 _param6)
Specify the distances to the near and far depth clipping planes.
Both distances must be positive.
.SH DESCRIPTION
_cmnd describes a perspective matrix that produces a perspective projection.
The current matrix (see _cmnd(MatrixMode)) is multiplied by this matrix
and the result replaces the current matrix, as if
_cmnd(MultMatrix) were called with the following matrix
as its argument:
.P
.sp 5
.ce
.EQ

{left [ ~~~ { 
down 165 matrix {
   ccol { {{2 ~ _eqnparam5} over {_eqnparam2 ~-~ _eqnparam1}} above 0 above 0 above 0 }
   ccol { 0 above {{2 ~ _eqnparam5} over {_eqnparam4 ~-~ _eqnparam3}} ~ above 0 above 0 }
   ccol { A ~~~~ above B ~~~~ above C ~~~~ above -1 ~~~~}
   ccol { 0 above 0 above D above 0}
}}

.EQ
down 130
{D ~=~ -^{{2 ~ _eqnparam6 ~ _eqnparam5} over {_eqnparam6 ~-~ _eqnparam5}}}
.EN
.sp 2
.P
Typically, the matrix mode is _const(PROJECTION), and
(_param1, _param3, \-_param5) and (_param2, _param4,  \-_param5)
specify the points on the near clipping plane that are mapped
to the lower left and upper right corners of the window,
assuming that the eye is located at (0, 0, 0).
\-_param6 specifies the location of the far clipping plane.
Both _param5 and _param6 must be positive.
.P
Use _cmnd(PushMatrix) and _cmnd(PopMatrix) to save and restore
the current matrix stack.
.SH NOTES
Depth buffer precision is affected by the values specified for
_param5 and _param6.
The greater the ratio of _param6 to _param5 is,
the less effective the depth buffer will be at distinguishing between
surfaces that are near each other.
If 
.sp
.ce
$r ~=~ _eqnparam6 over _eqnparam5$
.sp
roughly $log sub 2 (r)$ bits of depth buffer precision are lost.
Because $r$ approaches infinity as _param5 approaches 0,
_param5 must never be set to 0.
.SH ERRORS
_const(INVALID_VALUE) is generated if _param5 or _param6 is not
positive, or if _param1 = _param2, or _param3 = _param4.
.P
_const(INVALID_OPERATION) is generated if _cmnd
is executed between the execution of _cmnd(Begin)
and the corresponding execution of _cmnd(End).

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

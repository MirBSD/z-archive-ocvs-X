.SH DESCRIPTION
_cmnd sets up translation tables,
or \f2maps\fP,
used by
_cmnd(CopyPixels),
_cmnd(CopyTexImage1D),
_cmnd(CopyTexImage2D),
_cmnd(CopyTexSubImage1D),
_cmnd(CopyTexSubImage2D),
_cmnd(CopyTexSubImage3D),
_cmnd(DrawPixels),
_cmnd(ReadPixels),
_cmnd(TexImage1D),
_cmnd(TexImage2D),
_cmnd(TexImage3D),
_cmnd(TexSubImage1D),
_cmnd(TexSubImage2D), and
_cmnd(TexSubImage3D).
Additionally, if the _arbstring(imaging) subset is supported, the
routines
_cmnd(ColorTable),
_cmnd(ColorSubTable),
_cmnd(ConvolutionFilter1D),
_cmnd(ConvolutionFilter2D),
_cmnd(Histogram),
_cmnd(Minmax), and
_cmnd(SeparableFilter2D).
Use of these maps is described completely in the
_cmnd(PixelTransfer) reference page,
and partly in the reference pages for the pixel and texture image commands.
Only the specification of the maps is described in this reference page.
.P
_param1 is a symbolic map name,
indicating one of ten maps to set.
_param2 specifies the number of entries in the map,
and _param3 is a pointer to an array of _param2 map values.
.P
The ten maps are as follows:
.TP 30
_const(PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_I)
Maps color indices to color indices.
.TP
_const(PIXEL_MAP_S_TO_S)
Maps stencil indices to stencil indices.
.TP
_const(PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_R)
Maps color indices to red components.
.TP
_const(PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_G)
Maps color indices to green components.
.TP
_const(PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_B)
Maps color indices to blue components.
.TP
_const(PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_A)
Maps color indices to alpha components.
.TP
_const(PIXEL_MAP_R_TO_R)
Maps red components to red components.
.TP
_const(PIXEL_MAP_G_TO_G)
Maps green components to green components.
.TP
_const(PIXEL_MAP_B_TO_B)
Maps blue components to blue components.
.TP
_const(PIXEL_MAP_A_TO_A)
Maps alpha components to alpha components.
.P
The entries in a map can be specified as single-precision
floating-point numbers,
unsigned short integers,
or unsigned long integers.
Maps that store color component values
(all but _const(PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_I) and _const(PIXEL_MAP_S_TO_S))
retain their values in floating-point format,
with unspecified mantissa and exponent sizes.
Floating-point values specified by _cmnd(PixelMapfv) are converted directly
to the internal floating-point format of these maps,
then clamped to the range [0,1].
Unsigned integer values specified by _cmnd(PixelMapusv) and
_cmnd(PixelMapuiv) are converted linearly such that
the largest representable integer maps to 1.0,
and 0 maps to 0.0.
.P
Maps that store indices,
_const(PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_I) and _const(PIXEL_MAP_S_TO_S),
retain their values in fixed-point format,
with an unspecified number of bits to the right of the binary point.
Floating-point values specified by _cmnd(PixelMapfv) are converted directly
to the internal fixed-point format of these maps.
Unsigned integer values specified by _cmnd(PixelMapusv) and
_cmnd(PixelMapuiv) specify integer values,
with all 0's to the right of the binary point.
.P
The following table shows the initial sizes and values for each of the maps.
Maps that are indexed by either color or stencil indices must have
_param2 = $2 sup n$ for some $n$ or the results are undefined.
The maximum allowable size for each map depends on the implementation 
and can be determined by calling _cmnd(Get) with argument
_const(MAX_PIXEL_MAP_TABLE).
The single maximum applies to all maps; it is at
least 32.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

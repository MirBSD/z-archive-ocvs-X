_const(FOG_MODE),
_const(FOG_DENSITY),
_const(FOG_START),
_const(FOG_END),
and
_const(FOG_INDEX)
are accepted.

.SH PARAMETERS
_phead(_param1)
Specifies a fog parameter.
_const(FOG_MODE),
_const(FOG_DENSITY),
_const(FOG_START),
_const(FOG_END),
_const(FOG_INDEX),
and
_const(FOG_COLOR)
are accepted.
_phead(_param2)
Specifies the value or values to be assigned to _param1.
_const(FOG_COLOR) requires an array of four values.
All other parameters accept an array containing only a single value.
.SH DESCRIPTION
Fog is initially disabled.
While enabled, fog affects rasterized geometry,
bitmaps, and pixel blocks, but not buffer clear operations. To enable
and disable fog, call _cmnd(Enable) and _cmnd(Disable) with argument
_const(FOG). 
.P
_cmnd assigns the value or values in _param2 to the fog parameter
specified by _param1.
The following values are accepted for _param1:
.TP 20
_const(FOG_MODE)
_param2 is a single integer or floating-point value that specifies
the equation to be used to compute the fog blend factor, $f$.
Three symbolic constants are accepted:
_const(LINEAR),
_const(EXP),
and _const(EXP2).
The equations corresponding to these symbolic constants are defined below.
The initial fog mode is _const(EXP).
.TP
_const(FOG_DENSITY)
_param2 is a single integer or floating-point value that specifies $density$,
the fog density used in both exponential fog equations.
Only nonnegative densities are accepted.
The initial fog density is 1.
.TP
_const(FOG_START)
_param2 is a single integer or floating-point value that specifies $start$,
the near distance used in the linear fog equation.
The initial near distance is 0.
.TP
_const(FOG_END)
_param2 is a single integer or floating-point value that specifies $end$,
the far distance used in the linear fog equation.
The initial far distance is 1.
.TP
_const(FOG_INDEX)
_param2 is a single integer or floating-point value that specifies
$i sub f$,
the fog color index.
The initial fog index is 0.
.TP
_const(FOG_COLOR)
_param2 contains four integer or floating-point values that specify
$C sub f$, the fog color.
Integer values are mapped linearly such that the most positive representable
value maps to 1.0,
and the most negative representable value maps to \-1.0.
Floating-point values are mapped directly.
After conversion,
all color components are clamped to the range [0,1].
The initial fog color is (0, 0, 0, 0).
.P
Fog blends a fog color with each rasterized pixel fragment's posttexturing
color using a blending factor $f$.
Factor $f$ is computed in one of three ways,
depending on the fog mode.
Let $z$ be the distance in eye coordinates from the origin to the fragment
being fogged.
The equation for _const(LINEAR) fog is
.ce

.EQ
f ~=~ {end ~-~ z} over {end ~-~ start}
.EN

.RE
.P
The equation for _const(EXP) fog is
.ce

.EQ
f ~=~ e sup {-^(density ~cdot~ z)}
.EN

.P
The equation for _const(EXP2) fog is
.ce

.EQ
f ~=~ e sup {-^(density ~cdot~ z)} sup 2
.EN

.P
Regardless of the fog mode,
$f$ is clamped to the range [0,\ 1] after it is computed.
Then,
if the GL is in RGBA color mode,
the fragment's red, green, and blue colors, represented by $C sub r$,
are replaced by
.sp
.ce
.EQ
{C sub r} sup prime ~=~ f^C sub r ~+~ (1 - f)^C sub f 
.EN

.sp
Fog does not affect a fragment's alpha component.
.P
In color index mode, the fragment's color index $i sub r$ is replaced by
.sp
.ce
.EQ
{i sub r} sup prime ~=~ i sub r ~+~ (1 - f)^i sub f 
.EN
.P
.SH ERRORS
_const(INVALID_ENUM) is generated if _param1 is not an accepted value,
or if _param1 is _const(FOG_MODE) and _param2 is not an accepted value.
.P
_const(INVALID_VALUE) is generated if _param1 is _const(FOG_DENSITY), 
and _param2 is negative.
.P
_const(INVALID_OPERATION) is generated if _cmnd
is executed between the execution of _cmnd(Begin)
and the corresponding execution of _cmnd(End).

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

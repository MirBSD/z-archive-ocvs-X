.SH PARAMETERS
_phead(_param1)
Specifies the tessellation object (created with _cmnd(NewTess)).
_phead(_param2)
Specifies the type of the contour being defined. Valid values are
_gluconst(EXTERIOR),
_gluconst(INTERIOR),
_gluconst(UNKNOWN),
_gluconst(CCW), and
_gluconst(CW).
.SH DESCRIPTION
_cmnd is used in describing polygons with multiple contours. After the first
contour has been described through a series of _cmnd(TessVertex) calls, 
a _cmnd call indicates that the previous contour is complete and that the
next contour is about to begin.
Another series of _cmnd(TessVertex) calls is then used to describe the new 
contour. This process can be repeated until all contours have been described.
.P
_param2 defines what type of contour follows.
The legal contour types are as follows:
.TP 18
_gluconst(EXTERIOR)
An exterior contour defines an exterior boundary of the polygon.
.TP
_gluconst(INTERIOR)
An interior contour defines an interior boundary of the polygon (such as 
a hole).
.TP
_gluconst(UNKNOWN)
An unknown contour is analyzed by the library to determine if it is interior
or exterior.
.TP
_gluconst(CCW), 
.TP
_gluconst(CW)
The first _gluconst(CCW) or _gluconst(CW) contour defined is considered to 
be exterior. All other contours are considered to be exterior if they 
are oriented in the same direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) as 
the first contour, and interior if they are not.
.P
If one contour is of type _gluconst(CCW) or _gluconst(CW), then all 
contours must be of the same type (if they are not, then all _gluconst(CCW)
and _gluconst(CW) contours will be changed to _gluconst(UNKNOWN)).
.P
Note that there is no real difference between the _gluconst(CCW) and 
_gluconst(CW) contour types.
.P
Before the first contour is described, _cmnd can be called to 
define the type of the first contour.
If _cmnd is not called before the first contour, then the first contour is 
marked _gluconst(EXTERIOR).
.P
This command is obsolete and is provided for backward compatibility
only. Calls to _cmnd are mapped to _cmnd(TessEndContour)
followed by 
_cmnd(TessBeginContour).
.SH EXAMPLE
A quadrilateral with a triangular hole in it can be described as follows:
.sp
.Ex
gluBeginPolygon(tobj);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v1, v1);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v2, v2);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v3, v3);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v4, v4);
gluNextContour(tobj, GLU_INTERIOR);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v5, v5);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v6, v6);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v7, v7);
gluEndPolygon(tobj);

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.SH PARAMETERS
_phead(_param1)
Specifies a light source.
The number of possible lights depends on the implementation,
but at least eight lights are supported.
They are identified by symbolic names of the form _const(LIGHT)$i$
where 0 \(<= $ i $ < _const(MAX_LIGHTS).
_phead(_param2)
Specifies a light source parameter for _param1.
Accepted symbolic names are
_const(AMBIENT),
_const(DIFFUSE),
_const(SPECULAR),
_const(POSITION),
_const(SPOT_DIRECTION),
_const(SPOT_EXPONENT),
_const(SPOT_CUTOFF),
_const(CONSTANT_ATTENUATION),
_const(LINEAR_ATTENUATION), and
_const(QUADRATIC_ATTENUATION).
_phead(_param3)
Returns the requested data.
.SH DESCRIPTION
_cmnd returns in _param3 the value or values of a light source parameter.
_param1 names the light and is a symbolic name of the form _const(LIGHT)$i$
for 0 \(<= $i$ < _const(MAX_LIGHTS),
where _const(MAX_LIGHTS) is an implementation dependent constant that is
greater than or equal to eight.
_param2 specifies one of ten light source parameters,
again by symbolic name.
.P
The following parameters are defined:
.TP 20
_const(AMBIENT)
_param3 returns four integer or floating-point values representing the
ambient intensity of the light source.
Integer values,
when requested,
are linearly mapped from the internal floating-point representation
such that 1.0 maps to the most positive representable integer value,
and \-1.0 maps to the most negative representable integer value.
If the internal value is outside the range [\-1, 1],
the corresponding integer return value is undefined. The initial value is
(0, 0, 0, 1). 
.TP
_const(DIFFUSE)
_param3 returns four integer or floating-point values representing the
diffuse intensity of the light source.
Integer values,
when requested,
are linearly mapped from the internal floating-point representation
such that 1.0 maps to the most positive representable integer value,
and \-1.0 maps to the most negative representable integer value.
If the internal value is outside the range [\-1, 1],
the corresponding integer return value is undefined. The initial value
for _const(LIGHT0) is (1, 1, 1, 1); for other lights, the
initial value is (0, 0, 0, 0). 
.TP
_const(SPECULAR)
_param3 returns four integer or floating-point values representing the
specular intensity of the light source.
Integer values,
when requested,
are linearly mapped from the internal floating-point representation
such that 1.0 maps to the most positive representable integer value,
and \-1.0 maps to the most negative representable integer value.
If the internal value is outside the range [\-1, 1],
the corresponding integer return value is undefined. The initial value
for _const(LIGHT0) is (1, 1, 1, 1); for other lights, the
initial value is (0, 0, 0, 0).
.TP
_const(POSITION)
_param3 returns four integer or floating-point values representing the
position of the light source.
Integer values,
when requested,
are computed by rounding the internal floating-point values to the
nearest integer value.
The returned values are those maintained in eye coordinates.
They will not be equal to the values specified using _cmnd(Light),
unless the modelview matrix was identity at the time _cmnd(Light) was
called. The initial value is (0, 0, 1, 0).
.TP
_const(SPOT_DIRECTION)
_param3 returns three integer or floating-point values representing the
direction of the light source.
Integer values,
when requested,
are computed by rounding the internal floating-point values to the
nearest integer value.
The returned values are those maintained in eye coordinates.
They will not be equal to the values specified using _cmnd(Light),
unless the modelview matrix was identity at the time _cmnd(Light) was called.
Although spot direction is normalized before being used in the lighting
equation,
the returned values are the transformed versions of the specified values
prior to normalization. The initial value is (0, 0, \-1).
.TP
_const(SPOT_EXPONENT)
_param3 returns a single integer or floating-point value representing the
spot exponent of the light.
An integer value,
when requested,
is computed by rounding the internal floating-point representation to
the nearest integer. The initial value is 0. 
.TP
_const(SPOT_CUTOFF)
_param3 returns a single integer or floating-point value representing the
spot cutoff angle of the light.
An integer value,
when requested,
is computed by rounding the internal floating-point representation to
the nearest integer. The initial value is 180. 
.TP
_const(CONSTANT_ATTENUATION)
_param3 returns a single integer or floating-point value representing the
constant (not distance-related) attenuation of the light.
An integer value,
when requested,
is computed by rounding the internal floating-point representation to
the nearest integer. The initial value is 1. 
.TP
_const(LINEAR_ATTENUATION )
_param3 returns a single integer or floating-point value representing the
linear attenuation of the light.
An integer value,
when requested,
is computed by rounding the internal floating-point representation to
the nearest integer. The initial value is 0. 
.TP
_const(QUADRATIC_ATTENUATION)
_param3 returns a single integer or floating-point value representing the
quadratic attenuation of the light.
An integer value,
when requested,
is computed by rounding the internal floating-point representation to
the nearest integer. The initial value is 0. 
.SH NOTES
It is always the case that _const(LIGHT)$i$ = _const(LIGHT0) + $i$.
.P
If an error is generated,
no change is made to the contents of _param3.
.SH ERRORS
_const(INVALID_ENUM) is generated if _param1 or _param2 is not an
accepted value.
.P
_const(INVALID_OPERATION) is generated if _cmnd
is executed between the execution of _cmnd(Begin)
and the corresponding execution of _cmnd(End).

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

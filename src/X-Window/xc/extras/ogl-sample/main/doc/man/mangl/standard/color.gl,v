.SH PARAMETERS
_phead(_param1 _param2 _param3)
Specify new red, green, and blue values for the current color.
_phead(_param4)
Specifies a new alpha value for the current color.
Included only in the four-argument _cmnd(Color4) commands.
_names(Color,[34]u*[bsifd]v)
.SH PARAMETERS
_phead(_param1)
Specifies a pointer to an array that contains red, green, blue,
and (sometimes) alpha values.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The GL stores both a current single-valued color index
and a current four-valued RGBA color.
_cmnd sets a new four-valued RGBA color.
_cmnd has two major variants:
_cmnd(Color3) and _cmnd(Color4).
_cmnd(Color3) variants specify new red,
green,
and blue values explicitly
and set the current alpha value to 1.0 (full intensity) implicitly.
_cmnd(Color4) variants specify all four color components explicitly.
.P
_cmnd(Color3b), _cmnd(Color4b),
_cmnd(Color3s), _cmnd(Color4s), _cmnd(Color3i), and _cmnd(Color4i) take 
three or four signed byte, short, or long integers as arguments.
When \f3v\fP is appended to the name,
the color commands can take a pointer to an array of such values.
.P
Current color values are stored in floating-point format,
with unspecified mantissa and exponent sizes.
Unsigned integer color components,
when specified,
are linearly mapped to floating-point values such that the largest
representable value maps to 1.0 (full intensity),
and 0 maps to 0.0 (zero intensity).
Signed integer color components,
when specified,
are linearly mapped to floating-point values such that the most positive
representable value maps to 1.0,
and the most negative representable value maps to \-1.0. (Note that
this mapping does not convert 0 precisely to 0.0.)
Floating-point values are mapped directly.
.P
Neither floating-point nor signed integer values are clamped
to the range [0,1] before the current color is updated.
However,
color components are clamped to this range before they are interpolated
or written into a color buffer.
.SH NOTES
The initial value for the current color is (1, 1, 1, 1). 
.P
The current color can be updated at any time.
In particular,
_cmnd can be called between a call to _cmnd(Begin) and the corresponding
call to _cmnd(End).
.SH ASSOCIATED GETS
_cmnd(Get) with argument _const(CURRENT_COLOR)
.br
_cmnd(Get) with argument _const(RGBA_MODE)
.SH SEE ALSO
_cmnd(Index)

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

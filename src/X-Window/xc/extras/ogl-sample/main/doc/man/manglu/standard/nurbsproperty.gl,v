.SH DESCRIPTION
_cmnd is used to control properties stored in a NURBS object. These
properties affect the way that a NURBS curve is rendered. The accepted 
values for _param2 are as follows:
.TP 15
_gluconst(NURBS_MODE)
_param3 should be set to be either _gluconst(NURBS_RENDERER) or
_gluconst(NURBS_TESSELLATOR). When set to _gluconst(NURBS_RENDERER), NURBS objects
are tessellated into OpenGL primitives and sent to the pipeline for
rendering. When set to _gluconst(NURBS_TESSELLATOR), NURBS objects are
tessellated into OpenGL primitives but the vertices, normals, colors, and/or textures are 
retrieved back through a callback interface (see _cmnd(NurbsCallback)). This allows the user to cache the
tessellated results for further processing.
The initial value is _gluconst(NURBS_RENDERER).
.TP
_gluconst(SAMPLING_METHOD) 
Specifies how a NURBS surface should be
tessellated.
_param3 may be one of _gluconst(PATH_LENGTH),
_gluconst(PARAMETRIC_ERROR),  _gluconst(DOMAIN_DISTANCE),
_gluconst(OBJECT_PATH_LENGTH), or
_gluconst(OBJECT_PARAMETRIC_ERROR).
When set to _gluconst(PATH_LENGTH), the surface is rendered so that
the maximum length, in 
pixels, of the edges of the tessellation polygons is no greater than
what is specified by _gluconst(SAMPLING_TOLERANCE). 
.IP
_gluconst(PARAMETRIC_ERROR) specifies that the surface is rendered in such a 
way that the value specified by _gluconst(PARAMETRIC_TOLERANCE) describes the 
maximum distance, in pixels, between the tessellation polygons and the
surfaces they approximate. 
.IP
_gluconst(DOMAIN_DISTANCE) allows users to specify, in parametric coordinates,
how many sample points per unit length are taken in \f2u\fP, \f2v\fP
direction.
.IP
_gluconst(OBJECT_PATH_LENGTH)  is similar to _gluconst(PATH_LENGTH)
except that it is view independent, that is, the surface is rendered so that the maximum length, in object space, of edges of the tessellation polygons is no greater than what is specified by _gluconst(SAMPLING_TOLERANCE).
.IP   
_gluconst(OBJECT_PARAMETRIC_ERROR) is similar to  _gluconst(PARAMETRIC_ERROR) except that it is view independent, that is, the surface is rendered in such a way that the value specified by _gluconst(PARAMETRIC_TOLERANCE) describes the maximum distance, in object space, between the tessellation polygons and the surfaces they approximate.
.IP
The initial value of _gluconst(SAMPLING_METHOD) is _gluconst(PATH_LENGTH).
.TP
_gluconst(SAMPLING_TOLERANCE)
Specifies the maximum length, in pixels or in object space length unit,
to use when the sampling method is set to _gluconst(PATH_LENGTH) or
_gluconst(OBJECT_PATH_LENGTH).
The NURBS code is conservative when rendering a curve
or surface, so the actual length can be somewhat shorter. The initial
value is 50.0 pixels. 
.TP
_gluconst(PARAMETRIC_TOLERANCE)
Specifies the maximum distance, in pixels or in object space length unit,
to use when the sampling method is _gluconst(PARAMETRIC_ERROR) or
_gluconst(OBJECT_PARAMETRIC_ERROR).
The initial value is 0.5.
.TP
_gluconst(U_STEP)
Specifies the number of sample points per unit length taken
along the \f2u\fP axis in parametric coordinates. It is needed when
_gluconst(SAMPLING_METHOD) is set to _gluconst(DOMAIN_DISTANCE).
The initial value is 100.
.TP
_gluconst(V_STEP)
Specifies the number of sample points per unit length taken
along the \f2v\fP axis in parametric coordinate. It is needed when
_gluconst(SAMPLING_METHOD) is set to _gluconst(DOMAIN_DISTANCE). The initial 
value is 100.
.TP
_gluconst(DISPLAY_MODE)
_param3 can be set to
_gluconst(OUTLINE_POLYGON), _gluconst(FILL), or 
_gluconst(OUTLINE_PATCH).
When _gluconst(NURBS_MODE) is set to be _gluconst(NURBS_RENDERER),
_param3 defines how a NURBS surface should be rendered.
When _param3 is set to _gluconst(FILL), the surface is rendered as a
set of polygons. When _param3 is set to
_gluconst(OUTLINE_POLYGON), the NURBS library draws only the outlines
of the polygons created by tessellation. When _param3 is set to
_gluconst(OUTLINE_PATCH) just the outlines of patches and trim 
curves defined by the user are drawn.
.IP
When _gluconst(NURBS_MODE) is set to be _gluconst(NURBS_TESSELLATOR),
_param3 defines how a NURBS surface should be tessellated.
When _gluconst(DISPLAY_MODE) is set to _gluconst(FILL) or
_gluconst(OUTLINE_POLYGON), 
the NURBS surface is tessellated into OpenGL triangle primitives which can be
retrieved back  through callback functions. If _gluconst(DISPLAY_MODE) is set to 
_gluconst(OUTLINE_PATCH), only the outlines of the patches and trim curves are generated as a sequence of line strips which can be retrieved back through callback functions.
.IP
The initial value is _gluconst(FILL).
.TP
_gluconst(CULLING)
_param3 is a boolean value that, when set to _const(TRUE), indicates that 
a NURBS curve should be discarded prior to tessellation if its control points
lie outside the current viewport. The initial value is _const(FALSE).
.TP
_gluconst(AUTO_LOAD_MATRIX)
_param3 is a boolean value. When set to _const(TRUE), the NURBS code 
downloads the projection matrix, the modelview matrix, and the 
viewport from the GL server to compute sampling and 
culling
matrices for each NURBS curve that is rendered. Sampling and culling matrices
are required to determine the tessellation of a NURBS surface into line segments
or polygons and to cull a NURBS surface if it lies outside the viewport.
.IP
If this mode is set to _const(FALSE), then the program needs
to provide a projection matrix, a modelview matrix, and a viewport
for the NURBS renderer to use to construct sampling and culling matrices.
This can be done with the _cmnd(LoadSamplingMatrices) function.
This mode is initially set to _const(TRUE).
Changing it from _const(TRUE) to _const(FALSE) does not affect
the sampling and culling matrices until 
_cmnd(LoadSamplingMatrices)
is called.
.SH NOTES
If _gluconst(AUTO_LOAD_MATRIX) is true, sampling and culling may be
executed incorrectly if NURBS routines are compiled into a display list.
.P
A _param2 of 
_gluconst(PARAMETRIC_TOLERANCE),
_gluconst(SAMPLING_METHOD),
_gluconst(U_STEP), or
_gluconst(V_STEP),
or a _param3 of 
_gluconst(PATH_LENGTH),
_gluconst(PARAMETRIC_ERROR), 
_gluconst(DOMAIN_DISTANCE) 
are only available if the GLU version is 1.1 or greater. They are not
valid parameters in GLU 1.0. 
.P
_cmnd(GetString) can
be used to determine the GLU version. 
.P
_gluconst(NURBS_MODE) is only availble if the GLU version is 1.3 or
greater.
.P
The _gluconst(OBJECT_PATH_LENGTH) and _gluconst(OBJECT_PARAMETRIC_ERROR) 
values for the _gluconst(SAMPLING_METHOD) property are only available if 
the GLU version is 1.3 or greater.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

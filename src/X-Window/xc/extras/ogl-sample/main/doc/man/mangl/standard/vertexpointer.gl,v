.SH PARAMETERS
_phead(_param1)
Specifies the number of coordinates per vertex; must be 2, 3, or
4. The initial value is 4.
_phead(_param2)
Specifies the data type of each coordinate in the array.
Symbolic constants
_const(SHORT),
_const(INT),
_const(FLOAT),
and _const(DOUBLE) 
are accepted. The initial value is _const(FLOAT). 
_phead(_param3) 
Specifies the byte offset between consecutive 
vertices. If _param3 is 0, the vertices are understood to be tightly packed in 
the array. The initial value
is 0. 
_phead(_param4) 
Specifies a pointer to the first coordinate of the first vertex in the
array. The initial value is 0.
.SH DESCRIPTION
_cmnd specifies the location and data format of an array of vertex coordinates
to use when rendering.
_param1 specifies the number of coordinates per vertex and
_param2 the data type of
the coordinates. _param3 specifies the byte stride from one
vertex to the next allowing vertices and attributes
to be packed into a single array or stored in separate arrays.
(Single-array storage may be more efficient on some implementations;
see _cmnd(InterleavedArrays).)
When a vertex array is
specified, _param1, _param2, _param3, and _param4 are saved as client-side
state.
.P
To enable and disable the vertex array, call _cmnd(EnableClientState) and
.br 
_cmnd(DisableClientState) with the argument _const(VERTEX_ARRAY). If
enabled, the vertex array is used when 
_cmnd(DrawArrays), _cmnd(DrawElements), or _cmnd(ArrayElement) is called.
.P
Use _cmnd(DrawArrays) to construct a sequence of primitives (all of
the same type)
from prespecified vertex and vertex attribute arrays.
Use _cmnd(ArrayElement) to specify primitives
by indexing vertices and vertex attributes  and _cmnd(DrawElements) to
construct a sequence of primitives by indexing vertices and vertex attributes.
.SH NOTES
_cmnd is available only if the GL version is 1.1 or greater.
.P
The vertex array is initially disabled and isn't accessed when
_cmnd(ArrayElement), _cmnd(DrawElements) or _cmnd(DrawArrays) is called.
.P
Execution of _cmnd is not allowed between the execution of
_cmnd(Begin) and the corresponding execution of _cmnd(End),
but an error may or may not be generated. If no error is generated,
the operation is undefined.
.P
_cmnd is typically implemented on the client side.
.P
Vertex array parameters are client-side state and are therefore not
saved or restored by _cmnd(PushAttrib) and _cmnd(PopAttrib).
Use _cmnd(PushClientAttrib) and _cmnd(PopClientAttrib) instead.
.SH ERRORS
_const(INVALID_VALUE) is generated if _param1 is not 2, 3, or 4.
.P
_const(INVALID_ENUM) is generated if _param2 is is not an accepted value.
.P
_const(INVALID_VALUE) is generated if _param3 is negative.
.SH ASSOCIATED GETS  
_cmnd(IsEnabled) with argument _const(VERTEX_ARRAY)
.br
_cmnd(Get) with argument _const(VERTEX_ARRAY_SIZE)
.br
_cmnd(Get) with argument _const(VERTEX_ARRAY_TYPE)
.br
_cmnd(Get) with argument _const(VERTEX_ARRAY_STRIDE)

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

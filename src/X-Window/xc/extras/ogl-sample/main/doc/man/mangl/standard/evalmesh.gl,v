_const(LINE), and
_const(FILL) are accepted.
_phead(_param2 _param3)

_phead(_param4 _param5)
Specify the first and last integer values for grid domain variable $j$.
.SH DESCRIPTION
_cmnd(MapGrid) and _cmnd are used in tandem to efficiently
generate and evaluate a series of evenly-spaced map domain values.
_cmnd steps through the integer domain of a one- or two-dimensional grid,
whose range is the domain of the evaluation maps specified by
_cmnd(Map1) and _cmnd(Map2).
_param1(1) determines whether the resulting vertices are connected as
points,
lines,
or filled polygons.
.P
In the one-dimensional case,
_cmnd(EvalMesh1),
the mesh is generated as if the following code fragment were executed:
.nf
.IP
\f7
glBegin( \f2type\f7 );
for ( i = _param2; i <= _param3; i += 1 )
   glEvalCoord1( i$^cdot^DELTA u ~+~ u sub 1$ );
glEnd();
\fP
.RE
.fi
where
.sp
.in
$ DELTA u ~=~ (u sub 2 ~-~ u sub 1 ) ^/^ n$
.sp
.in 0
.P
and $n$, $u sub 1$, and $u sub 2$ are the arguments to the most recent
_cmnd(MapGrid1) command.
\f2type\fP is _const(POINTS) if _param1(1) is _const(POINT),
or _const(LINES) if _param1(1) is _const(LINE).
.P
The one absolute numeric requirement is that if $i ~=~ n$, then the
value computed from $ i^cdot^DELTA u ~+~ u sub 1$ is exactly $u sub 2$.
.P
In the two-dimensional case, _cmnd(EvalMesh2), let 
.nf
.IP
$ DELTA u ~=~ mark ( u sub 2 ~-~ u sub 1 ) ^/^ n$
.sp
$ DELTA v ~=~ lineup ( v sub 2 ~-~ v sub 1 ) ^/^ m$,
.fi
.RE
.P
where $n$, $u sub 1$, $u sub 2$, $m$, $v sub 1$, and $v sub 2$ are the
arguments to the most recent _cmnd(MapGrid2) command.  Then, if
_param1(2) is _const(FILL), the _cmnd(EvalMesh2) command is equivalent
to:
.nf
.IP
\f7
for ( j = _param4; j < _param5; j += 1 ) {
   glBegin( GL_QUAD_STRIP );
   for ( i = _param2; i <= _param3; i += 1 ) {
      glEvalCoord2( i$^cdot^DELTA u ~+~ u sub 1$, j$^cdot^DELTA v ~+~ v sub 1$ );
      glEvalCoord2( i$^cdot^DELTA u ~+~ u sub 1$, (j+1)$^cdot^DELTA v ~+~ v sub 1$ );
   }
   glEnd();
}
\fP
.RE
.fi
.P
If _param1 is _const(LINE), then a call to _cmnd(EvalMesh2) is equivalent to:
.nf
.IP
\f7
for ( j = _param4; j <= _param5; j += 1 ) {
   glBegin( GL_LINE_STRIP );
   for ( i = _param2; i <= _param3; i += 1 )
      glEvalCoord2( i$^cdot^DELTA u ~+~ u sub 1$, j$^cdot^DELTA v ~+~ v sub 1$ );
   glEnd();
}
.sp
for ( i = _param2;  i <= _param3; i += 1 ) {
   glBegin( GL_LINE_STRIP );
   for ( j = _param4; j <= _param4; j += 1 )
      glEvalCoord2( i$^cdot^DELTA u ~+~ u sub 1$, j$^cdot^DELTA v ~+~ v sub 1 $ );
   glEnd();
}
\fP
.RE
.fi
.P
And finally, if _param1 is _const(POINT), then a call to
_cmnd(EvalMesh2) is equivalent to:
.nf
.IP
\f7
glBegin( GL_POINTS );
for ( j = _param4; j <= _param5; j += 1 )
   for ( i = _param2; i <= _param3; i += 1 )
      glEvalCoord2( i$^cdot^DELTA u ~+~ u sub 1$, j$^cdot^DELTA v ~+~ v sub 1$ );
glEnd();
\fP
.RE
.fi
.P
In all three cases, the only absolute numeric requirements are that if $i~=~n$,
then the value computed from $i^cdot^DELTA u ~+~ u sub 1$ is exactly $u
sub 2$, and if $j~=~m$, then the value computed from
$j ^cdot^ DELTA v ~+~ v sub 1$ is exactly $v sub 2$.
.SH ERRORS
_const(INVALID_ENUM) is generated if _param1 is not an accepted value.
.P
_const(INVALID_OPERATION) is generated if _cmnd
is executed between the execution of _cmnd(Begin)
and the corresponding execution of _cmnd(End).

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.SH PARAMETERS
_phead(_param1)
Specifies the field of view angle, in degrees, in the \f2y\fP direction.
_phead(_param2)
Specifies the aspect ratio that determines
the field of view in the \f2x\fP direction.
The aspect ratio is the ratio of \f2x\fP (width) to \f2y\fP (height).
_phead(_param3)
Specifies the distance from the viewer to the near clipping plane
(always positive).
_phead(_param4)
Specifies the distance from the viewer to the far clipping plane
(always positive).
.SH DESCRIPTION
_cmnd specifies a viewing frustum into the world coordinate system.
In general, the aspect ratio in _cmnd should match the aspect ratio
of the associated viewport. For example, $ _eqnparam2 ~=~ 2.0 $ means 
the viewer's
angle of view is twice as wide in \f2x\fP as it is in \f2y\fP.
If the viewport is
twice as wide as it is tall, it displays the image without distortion.
.P
The matrix generated by _cmnd is multipled by the current matrix,
just as if _glcmnd(MultMatrix) were called with the generated matrix.
To load the perspective matrix onto the current matrix stack instead,
precede the call to _cmnd with a call to _glcmnd(LoadIdentity).
.P
Given \f2f\fP defined as follows:
.sp
.ce
.EQ
f  ~=~ cotangent"("{_eqnparam1 over 2}")"
.EN
.bp
The generated matrix is
.sp
.ce
.EQ
left ( ~~ down 130 { matrix {
   ccol { {f over _eqnparam2} above 0 above 0 above 0 }
   ccol { 0 above f above 0 above 0 }
   ccol { 0 above 0 above {{_eqnparam4 + _eqnparam3} over {_eqnparam3 - _eqnparam4}} above -1 }
   ccol { 0 above 0 above {{2 * _eqnparam4 * _eqnparam3} over {_eqnparam3 - _eqnparam4}} above 0}
}}  ~~~ right )
.EN

.SH NOTES
Depth buffer precision is affected by the values specified for
_param3 and _param4.
The greater the ratio of _param4 to _param3 is,
the less effective the depth buffer will be at distinguishing between
surfaces that are near each other.
If 
.sp
.ce
$r ~=~ _eqnparam4 over _eqnparam3$
.sp
.P
roughly $log sub 2 r$ bits of depth buffer precision are lost.
Because $r$ approaches infinity as _param3 approaches 0,
_param3 must never be set to 0.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

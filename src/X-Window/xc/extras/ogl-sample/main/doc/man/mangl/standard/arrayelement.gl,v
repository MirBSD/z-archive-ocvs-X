.SH PARAMETERS
_phead(_param1)
Specifies an index into the enabled vertex data arrays. 
.SH DESCRIPTION
_cmnd commands are used within _cmnd(Begin)/_cmnd(End) pairs to
specify vertex and attribute data for point, line, and polygon
primitives. If _const(VERTEX_ARRAY) is enabled when _cmnd is called, a
single vertex is drawn, using 
vertex and attribute data taken from location _param1 of the enabled
arrays. If _const(VERTEX_ARRAY) is not enabled, no drawing occurs but
the attributes corresponding to the enabled arrays are modified. 
.P
Use _cmnd to construct primitives by indexing vertex data, rather than
by streaming through arrays of data in first-to-last order. Because
each call specifies only a single vertex, it is possible to explicitly
specify per-primitive attributes such as a single normal per
individual triangle.
.P
Changes made to array data between the execution of _cmnd(Begin) and the 
corresponding execution of _cmnd(End) may affect calls to _cmnd that are made
within the same _cmnd(Begin)/_cmnd(End) period in non-sequential ways.
That is, a call to 
.br
_cmnd that precedes a change to array data may 
access the changed data, and a call that follows a change to array data 
may access original data.
.SH NOTES
_cmnd is available only if the GL version is 1.1 or greater.
.P
_cmnd is included in display lists. If _cmnd is entered into a
display list, the necessary array data (determined by the array
pointers and enables) is also entered into the display list. Because
the array pointers and enables are client-side state, their values
affect display lists when the lists are created, not when the lists
are executed.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

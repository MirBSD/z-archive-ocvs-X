.SH PARAMETERS
_phead(_param1)
Specifies the tessellation object (created with _cmnd(NewTess)).
_phead(_param2)
Specifies a pointer to user polygon data.
.SH DESCRIPTION
_cmnd(TessBeginPolygon) and _cmnd(TessEndPolygon) delimit the definition of a
convex, concave or self-intersecting polygon. Within each _cmnd(TessBeginPolygon)/_cmnd(TessEndPolygon)
pair, there must be one or more calls to _cmnd(TessBeginContour)/_cmnd(TessEndContour). 
Within each contour, there are zero or more calls to _cmnd(TessVertex). The vertices 
specify a closed contour (the last vertex of each contour is automatically linked 
to the first). See the _cmnd(TessVertex), _cmnd(TessBeginContour), and 
_cmnd(TessEndContour) reference pages for more details.
.P
_param2 is a pointer to a user-defined data structure. If the appropriate callback(s) 
are specified (see _cmnd(TessCallback)), then this pointer is returned to the 
callback function(s). Thus, it is a convenient way to store per-polygon information.
.P
Once _cmnd(TessEndPolygon) is called, the polygon is tessellated, and the
resulting triangles are described through callbacks.
See _cmnd(TessCallback) for descriptions of the callback functions.
.SH EXAMPLE
A quadrilateral with a triangular hole in it can be described as follows:
.sp
.Ex
gluTessBeginPolygon(tobj, NULL);
 gluTessBeginContour(tobj);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v1, v1);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v2, v2);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v3, v3);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v4, v4);
 gluTessEndContour(tobj);
.bp
 gluTessBeginContour(tobj);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v5, v5);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v6, v6);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v7, v7);
 gluTessEndContour(tobj);
gluTessEndPolygon(tobj);

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

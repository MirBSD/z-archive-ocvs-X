.EQ

.EN
.SH PARAMETERS
_phead(_param1)
Specifies the NURBS object (created with _cmnd(NewNurbsRenderer)).
_phead(_param2)
Specifies the callback being defined. 
Valid values are _gluconst(NURBS_BEGIN), _gluconst(NURBS_VERTEX), _gluconst(NURBS_NORMAL), _gluconst(NURBS_COLOR), _gluconst(NURBS_TEXTURE_COORD), _gluconst(NURBS_END), _gluconst(NURBS_BEGIN_DATA), _gluconst(NURBS_VERTEX_DATA), _gluconst(NURBS_NORMAL_DATA), _gluconst(NURBS_COLOR_DATA), _gluconst(NURBS_TEXTURE_COORD_DATA), _gluconst(NURBS_END_DATA), and _gluconst(NURBS_ERROR).
_phead(_param3)
Specifies the function that the callback calls.
.SH DESCRIPTION
_cmnd is used to define a callback to be used by a NURBS 
object.
If the specified callback is already defined, then it is replaced.  If 
_param3 is NULL, then this callback will not get
invoked and the related data, if any, will be lost.
.P
Except the error callback, these callbacks are used by NURBS tessellator (when _gluconst(NURBS_MODE) is set to be _gluconst(NURBS_TESSELLATOR)) to return back the OpenGL
polygon primitives resulting from the tessellation. Note that there are two
versions of each callback: one with a user data pointer and one without. If both versions for a particular callback are specified then the callback with 
the user data pointer will be used. Note that ``userData'' is a copy of the pointer that was specified at the last call to _cmnd(NurbsCallbackData).
.P
The error callback function is effective no matter which value that
_gluconst(NURBS_MODE) is set to.
All other callback functions are effective only when _gluconst(NURBS_MODE)
is set to _gluconst(NURBS_TESSELLATOR).
.P
The legal callbacks are as follows:
.TP 10
_gluconst(NURBS_BEGIN)
The begin callback indicates the start of a primitive. The function
takes a single argument of type GLenum, which can be one of 
_const(LINES), _const(LINE_STRIP), _const(TRIANGLE_FAN), _const(TRIANGLE_STRIP), _const(TRIANGLES), or _const(QUAD_STRIP). The
default begin callback function is NULL. The function prototype
for this callback looks like:
.RS
.Ex
void begin ( GLenum type );
.Ee
.RE
.TP
_gluconst(NURBS_BEGIN_DATA)
The same as the _gluconst(NURBS_BEGIN) callback except that it takes an
additional pointer argument. This pointer is a copy of the pointer that
was specified at the last call to _cmnd(NurbsCallbackData).  The
default callback function is NULL. The function prototype for this
callback function looks like:
.RS
.Ex
void beginData (GLenum type, void *userData);
.Ee
.RE
.TP
_gluconst(NURBS_VERTEX)
The vertex callback indicates a vertex of the primitive. The
coordinates of the vertex are stored in the parameter ``vertex''. All
the generated vertices have dimension 3, that is, homogeneous
coordinates have been transformed into affine coordinates. The default
vertex callback function is NULL. The function prototype for this
callback function looks like:
.RS
.Ex
void vertex ( GLfloat *vertex );
.Ee
.RE
.TP
_gluconst(NURBS_VERTEX_DATA)
This is the same as the _gluconst(NURBS_VERTEX) callback, except that
it takes an additional pointer argument. This pointer is a copy of the
pointer that was specified at the last call to
_cmnd(NurbsCallbackData).  The default callback function is NULL. The
function prototype for this callback function looks like:
.RS
.Ex
void vertexData ( GLfloat *vertex, void *userData );
.Ee
.RE
.TP
_gluconst(NURBS_NORMAL)
The normal callback is invoked as the vertex normal is generated.
The components of the normal are stored in the parameter ``normal''.
In the case of a NURBS curve, the callback function is effective only when 
the user provides a normal map (_const(MAP1_NORMAL)).
In the case of a NURBS surface, if a normal map (_const(MAP2_NORMAL)) is provided, then the generated normal is computed from the normal map.
If a normal map is not provided then a surface normal is computed in
a manner similar to that described for evaluators when _const(AUTO_NORMAL)
is enabled. 
.bp
The default normal callback function is NULL. The function
prototype for this callback function looks like:
.RS
.Ex
void normal ( GLfloat *normal );
.Ee
.RE
.TP
_gluconst(NURBS_NORMAL_DATA)
The same as the _gluconst(NURBS_NORMAL) callback except that it
takes an additional pointer argument. This pointer is a copy of the pointer
that was specified at the last call to _cmnd(NurbsCallbackData).  The default callback function is NULL. The function prototype for this callback function looks like:
.RS
.Ex
void normalData ( GLfloat *normal, void *userData );
.Ee
.RE
.TP
_gluconst(NURBS_COLOR)
The color callback is invoked as the color of a vertex is generated.
The components of the color are stored in the parameter ``color''.
This callback is effective only when the user provides a color map
(_const(MAP1_COLOR_4) or _const(MAP2_COLOR_4)). ``color'' contains four components: R,G,B,A. The default color callback function is NULL. The prototype for
this callback function looks like:
.RS
.Ex
void color ( GLfloat *color );
.Ee
.RE
.TP
_gluconst(NURBS_COLOR_DATA)
The same as the _gluconst(NURBS_COLOR) callback except that it
takes an additional pointer argument. This pointer is a copy of the pointer
that was specified at the last call to _cmnd(NurbsCallbackData).  The default callback function is NULL. The function prototype for this callback function looks like:
.RS
.Ex
void colorData ( GLfloat *color, void *userData );
.Ee
.RE
.TP
_gluconst(NURBS_TEXTURE_COORD)
The texture callback is invoked as the texture coordinates 
of a vertex are generated. These coordinates are stored in the parameter
``texCoord''. The number of texture coordinates can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 depending
on which type of texture map is specified 
(_const(MAP1_TEXTURE_COORD_1),
_const(MAP1_TEXTURE_COORD_2),
_const(MAP1_TEXTURE_COORD_3),
_const(MAP1_TEXTURE_COORD_4),
_const(MAP2_TEXTURE_COORD_1),
_const(MAP2_TEXTURE_COORD_2),
_const(MAP2_TEXTURE_COORD_3),
_const(MAP2_TEXTURE_COORD_4)).
If no texture map is specified, this callback function will not be called.
.bp
The default texture callback function is NULL. The function prototype
for this callback function looks like:
.RS
.Ex
void texCoord ( GLfloat *texCoord );
.Ee
.RE
.TP
 _gluconst(NURBS_TEXTURE_COORD_DATA)
This is the same as the _gluconst(NURBS_TEXTURE_COORD) callback, except that it
takes an additional pointer argument. This pointer is a copy of the pointer
that was specified at the last call to _cmnd(NurbsCallbackData).  The default callback function is NULL. The function prototype for this callback function looks like:
.RS
.Ex
void texCoordData (GLfloat *texCoord, void *userData);
.Ee
.RE
.TP
_gluconst(NURBS_END)
The end callback is invoked at the end of a primitive. The default end callback function is NULL. The function prototype for this callback function looks like:
.RS
.Ex
void end ( void );
.Ee
.RE
.TP
_gluconst(NURBS_END_DATA)
This is the same as the _gluconst(NURBS_END) callback, except that it
takes an additional pointer argument. This pointer is a copy of the pointer
that was specified at the last call to _cmnd(NurbsCallbackData).  The default callback function is NULL. The function prototype for this callback function looks like:
.RS
.Ex
void endData ( void  *userData );
.Ee
.RE
.TP
_gluconst(NURBS_ERROR)
The error function is called when an error is encountered.
Its single argument
is of type GLenum, and it indicates the specific error that occurred.
There are 37 errors unique to NURBS named
_gluconst(NURBS_ERROR1) through _gluconst(NURBS_ERROR37). 
Character strings describing these errors can be retrieved with
_cmnd(ErrorString).
.bp
.SH NOTES
_cmnd is available only if the GLU version is 1.2 or greater.
.P
GLU version 1.2 supports only the _gluconst(ERROR) parameter for
_param2. The _gluconst(ERROR) value is deprecated in GLU version 1.3 in
favor of _gluconst(NURBS_ERROR).  All other accepted values for _param3
are available only if the GLU version is 1.3 or greater.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

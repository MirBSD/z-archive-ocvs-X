.SH PARAMETERS
_phead(_param1)
Specifies the target texture.  Must be _const(TEXTURE_1D).
_phead(_param2)
Requests the internal storage format of the texture image.  The most
current version of the SGI implementation of GLU does not check this
value for validity before passing it on to the underlying OpenGL
implementation.  A value that is not accepted by the OpenGL
implementation will lead to an OpenGL error.  The benefit of not
checking this value at the GLU level is that OpenGL extensions can add
new internal texture formats without requiring a revision of the GLU
implementation.  Older implementations of GLU check this value and
raise a GLU error if it is not 1, 2, 3, or 4 or one of the following
symbolic constants:
_const(ALPHA),
_const(ALPHA4),
_const(ALPHA8),
_const(ALPHA12),
_const(ALPHA16),

_const(RGB5_A1),
_const(RGBA8),
_const(RGB10_A2),
_const(RGBA12) or
_const(RGBA16).
_phead(_param3)
Specifies the width in pixels of the texture image. 
This should be a power of 2.
_phead(_param4)
Specifies the format of the pixel data.
Must be one of:
_const(COLOR_INDEX),
_const(DEPTH_COMPONENT),
_const(RED),
_const(GREEN),
_const(BLUE),
_const(ALPHA),
_const(RGB),
_const(RGBA),
_const(BGR),
_const(BGRA),
_const(LUMINANCE), or
_const(LUMINANCE_ALPHA).
_phead(_param5)
Specifies the data type for _param9.

_const(UNSIGNED_INT_8_8_8_8),
_const(UNSIGNED_INT_8_8_8_8_REV),
_const(UNSIGNED_INT_10_10_10_2), or
_const(UNSIGNED_INT_2_10_10_10_REV).
_phead(_param6)
Specifies the mipmap level of the image data.
_phead(_param7)
Specifies the minimum mipmap level to pass to _glcmnd(TexImage1D).
_phead(_param8)
Specifies the maximum mipmap level to pass to _glcmnd(TexImage1D).
_phead(_param9)
Specifies a pointer to the image data in memory.
.SH DESCRIPTION
_cmnd builds a subset of prefiltered one-dimensional texture maps of decreasing
resolutions called a mipmap. This is used for the antialiasing of
texture mapped primitives.
.P
A return value of zero indicates success, otherwise a GLU error code is
returned (see _cmnd(ErrorString)).
.P
A series of mipmap levels from _param7 to _param8 is built by decimating 
_param9 in half 
until size $1 ~times~ 1$ is reached. At each level, each texel in the
halved mipmap level is an average of the corresponding two texels in the larger
mipmap level. 
_glcmnd(TexImage1D) is called to load these mipmap levels from _param7
to _param8. If _param8 is larger than the highest mipmap level for the
texture of the specified size, then a GLU error code is returned (see
_cmnd(ErrorString)) and nothing is loaded.
.P
For example, if _param6 is 2 and _param3 is 16, the
following levels are possible: $16 ~times~ 1$, $8 ~times~ 1$, $4 ~times~ 1$,
$2 ~times~ 1$, $1 ~times~ 1$. These correspond
to levels 2 through 6 respectively.
If _param7 is 3 and _param8 is 5, then only mipmap levels $8 ~times~ 1$,
$4 ~times~ 1$ and $2 ~times~ 1$ are
loaded. However, if _param8 is 7 then an error is returned and nothing is
loaded since _param8 is larger than the highest mipmap level which is, in 
this case, 6.
.P
The highest mipmap level can be derived from the formula
${log sub 2} (_param3^{2 sup _param6})$.
.P
See the _glcmnd(TexImage1D) reference page for a description of the
acceptable values for _param5 parameter. See the _glcmnd(DrawPixels) 
reference page for a description of the acceptable values 
for _param6 parameter.

.SH NOTES
_cmnd is only available if the GLU version is 1.3 or greater.

_const(UNSIGNED_INT_10_10_10_2), and
_const(UNSIGNED_INT_2_10_10_10_REV) are only available if the GL version 
is 1.2 or greater.
.SH ERRORS
_gluconst(INVALID_VALUE) is returned if _param6 > _param7, _param7 < 0,
_param8 < _param7 or _param8 is > the highest mipmap level for _param9.
.P
_gluconst(INVALID_VALUE) is returned if _param3 is < 1.
.P
_gluconst(INVALID_ENUM) is returned if _param2, _param4, or _param5 are not 
legal.
.P
_gluconst(INVALID_OPERATION) is returned if _param5 is _const(UNSIGNED_BYTE_3_3_2) or _const(UNSIGNED_BYTE_2_3_3_REV)
and _param4 is not _const(RGB).
.P
_gluconst(INVALID_OPERATION) is returned if _param5 is _const(UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_6_5) or _const(UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_6_5_REV)
and _param4 is not _const(RGB).
.P
_gluconst(INVALID_OPERATION) is returned if _param5 is _const(UNSIGNED_SHORT_4_4_4_4) or _const(UNSIGNED_SHORT_4_4_4_4_REV)
and _param4 is neither _const(RGBA) nor _const(BGRA).
.P
_gluconst(INVALID_OPERATION) is returned if _param5 is _const(UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_5_5_1) or _const(UNSIGNED_SHORT_1_5_5_5_REV)
and _param4 is neither _const(RGBA) nor _const(BGRA).
.P
_gluconst(INVALID_OPERATION) is returned if _param5 is _const(UNSIGNED_INT_8_8_8_8) or _const(UNSIGNED_INT_8_8_8_8_REV)
and _param4 is neither _const(RGBA) nor _const(BGRA).
.P
_gluconst(INVALID_OPERATION) is returned if _param5 is _const(UNSIGNED_INT_10_10_10_2) or _const(UNSIGNED_INT_2_10_10_10_REV)

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

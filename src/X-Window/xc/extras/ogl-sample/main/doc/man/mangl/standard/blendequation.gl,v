.SH PARAMETERS
_phead(_param1)
specifies how source and destination colors are combined.
It must be _const(FUNC_ADD), _const(FUNC_SUBTRACT),
_const(FUNC_REVERSE_SUBTRACT), _const(MIN), _const(MAX).

.SH DESCRIPTION
The blend equation determines how a new pixel (the ``source'' color)
is combined with a pixel already in the framebuffer (the ``destination''
color).
.TP
_const(MIN)
sets the blend equation so that each component of the result color
is the minimum of the corresponding components of the source and destination
colors.
.TP
_const(MAX)
sets the blend equation so that each component of the result color
is the maximum of the corresponding components of the source and destination
colors.
.P
The remaining blend equations use the source and destination blend factors
specified by _cmnd(BlendFunc).
See _cmnd(BlendFunc) for a description of the various blend factors. 
.P
In the equations that follow, source and destination
color components are referred to as
$(R sub s, G sub s, B sub s, A sub s )$ 
and
$(R sub d, G sub d, B sub d, A sub d )$,
respectively.
The result color is referred to as 
$(R sub r, G sub r, B sub r, A sub r )$.
The source and destination blend factors are denoted 
$(s sub R, s sub G, s sub B, s sub A )$ and 
$(d sub R, d sub G, d sub B, d sub A )$, respectively.
For these equations all color components are understood to have values
in the range [0,\ 1].
.TP
_const(FUNC_ADD)
sets the blend equation so that the source and destination
data are added.
Each component of the source color is
multiplied by the corresponding source factor, then
each component of the destination color is multiplied
by the corresponding destination factor.
The result is the componentwise sum of the two products, clamped to the
range [0,\ 1].

.RE
.TP
_const(FUNC_SUBTRACT)
Is like _const(FUNC_ADD) except the product of the destination factor and
the destination color is componentwise subtracted from the product of the
source factor and the source color.
The result is clamped to the range [0,\ 1].

.RE
.TP
_const(FUNC_REVERSE_SUBTRACT)

source color is componentwise subtracted from the product of the destination
factor and the destination color.

$Ar ~=~ lineup max (0 , ~A sub d~d sub A ~-~ A sub s~s sub A )$
.fi
.RE
.P
The _const(MIN) and _const(MAX) equations are useful for applications
that analyze
.br
image data (image thresholding against a constant color,
for example).
The _const(FUNC_ADD) equation is useful
for antialiasing and transparency, among other things.
.P
Initially, the blend equation is set to _const(FUNC_ADD).
.P
.SH NOTES
_cmnd is part of the _arbstring(imaging) subset. _cmnd is present only
if _arbstring(imaging) is returned when _cmnd(GetString) is called with
_const(EXTENSIONS) as its argument.
.P
The _const(MIN), and _const(MAX) equations do not use
the source or destination factors, only the source and destination colors.
.P
.SH ERRORS
_const(INVALID_ENUM) is generated if _param1 is not one of 
_const(FUNC_ADD), _const(FUNC_SUBTRACT), _const(FUNC_REVERSE_SUBTRACT),
_const(MAX), or _const(MIN).
.P
_const(INVALID_OPERATION) is generated if _cmnd is executed
between the execution of _cmnd(Begin) and the corresponding
execution of _cmnd(End).
.SH ASSOCIATED GETS
.TP
_cmnd(Get) with an argument of _const(BLEND_EQUATION)

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.SH PARAMETERS
_phead(_param1)
Specifies the NURBS object (created with _cmnd(NewNurbsRenderer)).
_phead(_param2)
Specifies the number of knots in _param3.
_param2 equals the number of control points plus the order.
_phead(_param3)
Specifies an array of _param2 nondecreasing knot values.
_phead(_param4)
Specifies the offset (as a number of single-precision floating-point values)
between successive curve control points.
_phead(_param5)
Specifies a pointer to an array of control points. The coordinates must
agree with _param7, specified below.
_phead(_param6)
Specifies the order of the NURBS curve. _param6 equals degree + 1, hence
a cubic curve has an order of 4.
_phead(_param7)
Specifies the type of the curve. If this curve is defined within a 
_cmnd(BeginCurve)/_cmnd(EndCurve) pair, then 
the type can be any of the valid
one-dimensional evaluator types (such as _const(MAP1_VERTEX_3) or 
_const(MAP1_COLOR_4)). Between a _cmnd(BeginTrim)/_cmnd(EndTrim) pair,
the only valid types are _gluconst(MAP1_TRIM_2) and _gluconst(MAP1_TRIM_3).
.SH DESCRIPTION
Use _cmnd to describe a NURBS curve.
.P
When _cmnd appears between a _cmnd(BeginCurve)/_cmnd(EndCurve) pair, it is 
used to describe a curve to be rendered.
Positional, texture, and color coordinates are associated
by presenting each as a separate _cmnd between a 
_cmnd(BeginCurve)/_cmnd(EndCurve) pair. No more than
one call to _cmnd for each of color, position, and texture
data can be made within a single _cmnd(BeginCurve)/_cmnd(EndCurve)
pair. Exactly one call must be made to describe the position of the 
curve (a _param7 of _const(MAP1_VERTEX_3) or _const(MAP1_VERTEX_4)).
.P
When _cmnd appears between a _cmnd(BeginTrim)/_cmnd(EndTrim) pair, it is 
used to describe a trimming curve on a NURBS surface. If _param7 is
_gluconst(MAP1_TRIM_2), then it describes a curve in two-dimensional (\f2u\fP 
and \f2v\fP)
parameter space. If it is _gluconst(MAP1_TRIM_3), then it describes a 
curve in two-dimensional homogeneous (\f2u\fP, \f2v\fP, and \f2w\fP) 
parameter space.
See the _cmnd(BeginTrim) reference page for more discussion about trimming
curves.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following commands render a textured NURBS curve with normals:
.sp
.Ex
gluBeginCurve(nobj);
   gluNurbsCurve(nobj, ..., GL_MAP1_TEXTURE_COORD_2);
   gluNurbsCurve(nobj, ..., GL_MAP1_NORMAL);
   gluNurbsCurve(nobj, ..., GL_MAP1_VERTEX_4);
gluEndCurve(nobj);
.Ee
.sp
.SH NOTES
To define trim curves which stitch well, use _cmnd(PwlCurve).
.SH SEE ALSO
_cmnd(BeginCurve), _cmnd(BeginTrim), _cmnd(NewNurbsRenderer), _cmnd(PwlCurve)

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.SH PARAMETERS
_phead(_param1)
Specifies the NURBS object (created with _cmnd(NewNurbsRenderer)).
.SH DESCRIPTION
Use _cmnd(BeginTrim) to mark the beginning of a
trimming loop, and _cmnd(EndTrim) to mark the end 
of a trimming loop. A trimming loop is 
a set of oriented curve segments (forming a closed curve) that
define boundaries of a NURBS surface. You include these
trimming loops in the definition of a NURBS 
surface, between calls to _cmnd(BeginSurface) and _cmnd(EndSurface).
.P
The definition for a NURBS surface can contain many
trimming loops. For example, if you wrote a definition
for a NURBS surface that resembled a rectangle with
a hole punched out, the definition would contain two 
trimming loops. One loop would define the outer edge
of the rectangle; the other would define
the hole punched out of the rectangle. The definitions
of each of these trimming loops would be bracketed by a
_cmnd(BeginTrim)/_cmnd(EndTrim) pair.
.P
The definition of a single closed trimming loop can consist
of multiple curve segments, each described as a piecewise
linear curve (see _cmnd(PwlCurve)) or as a single NURBS
curve (see _cmnd(NurbsCurve)), or as a combination of 
both in any order. The only library calls that can 
appear in a trimming loop definition (between the calls
to _cmnd(BeginTrim) and _cmnd(EndTrim)) are 
_cmnd(PwlCurve) and _cmnd(NurbsCurve).
.P
The area of the NURBS surface that is displayed is the
region in the domain to the left of the trimming curve
as the curve parameter increases. Thus, the retained
region of the NURBS surface is inside a 
counterclockwise trimming loop and outside a clockwise
trimming loop. For the rectangle mentioned earlier,
the trimming loop for the outer edge of the rectangle runs
counterclockwise, while the trimming loop for the punched-out hole 
runs clockwise.
.P
If you use more than one curve to define a single trimming 
loop, the curve segments must form a closed loop (that is,
the endpoint of each curve must be the starting point of the
next curve, and the endpoint of the final curve must
be the starting point of the first curve). If the 
endpoints of the curve are sufficiently close together
but not exactly coincident, they will be coerced to match.
If the endpoints are not sufficiently close, an error results
(see _cmnd(NurbsCallback)).
.P
If a trimming loop definition contains multiple curves,
the direction of the curves must be consistent (that is, the
inside must be to the left of all of the curves). Nested
trimming loops are legal as long as the curve orientations
alternate correctly.
If trimming curves are self-intersecting,
or intersect one another, an error results.
.P
If no trimming information is given
for a NURBS surface, the entire surface is drawn.
.SH EXAMPLE
This code fragment defines a trimming loop that consists of one
piecewise linear curve, and two NURBS curves:
.sp
.Ex
gluBeginTrim(nobj);
   gluPwlCurve(..., GLU_MAP1_TRIM_2);
   gluNurbsCurve(..., GLU_MAP1_TRIM_2);
   gluNurbsCurve(..., GLU_MAP1_TRIM_3);
gluEndTrim(nobj);

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

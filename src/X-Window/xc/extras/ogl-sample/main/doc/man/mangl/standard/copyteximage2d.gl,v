.SH DESCRIPTION
_cmnd defines a two-dimensional texture image with pixels from the current
_const(READ_BUFFER).
.P
The screen-aligned pixel rectangle with lower left corner at (_param4,
_param5) and with a width of _param6$~+~2~*~$_param8 and a height of
_param7$~+~2~*~$_param8 
defines the texture array
at the mipmap level specified by _param2.
_param3 specifies the internal format of the texture array.
.P
The pixels in the rectangle are processed exactly as if
_cmnd(CopyPixels) had been called, but the process stops just before
final conversion.
At this point all pixel component values are clamped to the range $[0,1]$
and then converted to the texture's internal format for storage in the texel
array.
.P
Pixel ordering is such that lower $x$ and $y$ screen coordinates correspond to 
lower $s$ and $t$ texture coordinates.
.P
If any of the pixels within the specified rectangle of the current
_const(READ_BUFFER) are outside the window associated with the current
rendering context, then the values obtained for those pixels are undefined.
.P
.SH NOTES
_cmnd is available only if the GL version is 1.1 or greater.
.P
Texturing has no effect in color index mode.
.P
1, 2, 3, and 4 are not accepted values for _param3.
.P 
An image with height or width of 0 indicates a NULL texture. 
.P
When the _arbstring(imaging) extension is supported, the RGBA components
read from the framebuffer may be processed by the imaging pipeline.  See
_cmnd(TexImage1D) for specific details.
.SH ERRORS
_const(INVALID_ENUM) is generated if _param1 is not _const(TEXTURE_2D).
.P
_const(INVALID_VALUE) is generated if _param2 is less than 0.
.P 
_const(INVALID_VALUE) may be generated if _param2 is greater
than $log sub 2 max$,
where $max$ is the returned value of _const(MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE).
.P
_const(INVALID_VALUE) is generated if _param6 or _param7 is less than 0,
greater than $2~+~$_const(MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE), or if _param6 or _param7 cannot be
represented as $2 sup k ~+~ 2~*~$_param8 for some integer
$k$.
.P
_const(INVALID_VALUE) is generated if _param8 is not 0 or 1.
.P
_const(INVALID_VALUE) is generated if _param3 is not one of the
allowable values.
.P
_const(INVALID_OPERATION) is generated if _cmnd is executed
between the execution of _cmnd(Begin) and the corresponding
execution of _cmnd(End).

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

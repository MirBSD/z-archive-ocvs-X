.SH PARAMETERS
_phead(_param1)
Specifies a texture coordinate.
Must be one of _const(S), _const(T), _const(R), or _const(Q).
_phead(_param2)
Specifies the symbolic name of the texture-coordinate generation function
or function parameters.
Must be
_const(TEXTURE_GEN_MODE),
_const(OBJECT_PLANE), or
_const(EYE_PLANE). 
_phead(_param3)
Specifies a pointer to an array of texture generation parameters.
If _param2 is _const(TEXTURE_GEN_MODE),
then the array must contain a single symbolic constant,
one of
_const(OBJECT_LINEAR),
_const(EYE_LINEAR), or
_const(SPHERE_MAP). 
Otherwise,
_param3 holds the coefficients for the texture-coordinate generation function
specified by _param2.
.SH DESCRIPTION
_cmnd selects a texture-coordinate generation function
or supplies coefficients for one of the functions.
_param1 names one of the (\f2s\fP, \f2t\fP, \f2r\fP, \f2q\fP) texture
coordinates; it must be one of the symbols
_const(S),
_const(T),
_const(R), or
_const(Q).
_param2 must be one of three symbolic constants:
_const(TEXTURE_GEN_MODE),
_const(OBJECT_PLANE), or
_const(EYE_PLANE). 
If _param2 is _const(TEXTURE_GEN_MODE),
then _param3 chooses a mode,
one of
_const(OBJECT_LINEAR),
_const(EYE_LINEAR), or
_const(SPHERE_MAP). 
If _param2 is either _const(OBJECT_PLANE) or _const(EYE_PLANE),
_param3 contains coefficients for the corresponding
texture generation function.
.P 
If the texture generation function is _const(OBJECT_LINEAR),
the function
.P
.ce
$g ~=~ p sub 1^x sub o ~+~ p sub 2^y sub o ~+~ p sub 3^z sub o ~+~ p sub 4^w sub o$
.P
.br
is used, where $g$ is the value computed for the coordinate named in _param1,
$p sub 1$,
$p sub 2$,
$p sub 3$,
and
$p sub 4$ are the four values supplied in _param3, and
$x sub o$,
$y sub o$,
$z sub o$, and
$w sub o$ are the object coordinates of the vertex.
This function can be used, for example, to texture-map terrain using sea level
as a reference plane
(defined by $p sub 1$, $p sub 2$, $p sub 3$, and $p sub 4$). 
The altitude of a terrain vertex is computed by the _const(OBJECT_LINEAR)
coordinate generation function as its distance from sea level; 
that altitude can then be used to index the texture image to map white snow
onto peaks and green grass onto foothills.
.P
If the texture generation function is _const(EYE_LINEAR), the function
.P
.ce
$g ~=~ p sub 1 sup prime ^x sub e ~+~ p sub 2 sup prime ^y sub e ~+~ p sub 3 sup prime ^z sub e ~+~ p sub 4 sup prime ^w sub e$
.P
.br
is used, where 
.P
.ce
$( p sub 1 sup prime
~~p sub 2 sup prime~~p sub 3 sup prime~~
{ p sub 4 sup prime}) ~=~ ( p sub 1~~ p sub 2~~ p sub 3~~ p sub 4 ) ~M sup -1$
.P
.br
and
$x sub e$,
$y sub e$,
$z sub e$, and
$w sub e$ are the eye coordinates of the vertex,
$p sub 1$,
$p sub 2$,
$p sub 3$,
and
$p sub 4$ are the values supplied in _param3, and
$M$ is the modelview matrix when _cmnd is invoked.
If $M$ is poorly conditioned or singular,
texture coordinates generated by the resulting function may be inaccurate
or undefined.
.P
Note that the values in _param3 define a reference plane in eye coordinates. 
The modelview matrix that is applied to them may not be the same one
in effect when the polygon vertices are transformed. 
This function establishes a field of texture coordinates
that can produce dynamic contour lines on moving objects.
.P
If _param2 is _const(SPHERE_MAP) and _param1 is either
_const(S) or
_const(T),
$s$ and $t$ texture coordinates are generated as follows. 
Let \f2u\fP be the unit vector pointing from the origin to the polygon vertex
(in eye coordinates). 
Let \f2n\fP sup prime be the current normal,
after transformation to eye coordinates. 
Let 
.P
.ce
$f ~=~ ( f sub x~~f sub y~~f sub z ) sup T$
be the reflection vector such that
.P
.ce
$f ~=~  u ~-~ 2 n sup prime n sup prime sup T u$
.br
.P
Finally, let $ m ~=~ 2 sqrt { f sub x sup {~2} ~+~ f sub y sup {~2} ~+~ (f sub z ~+~ 1 ) sup 2}$. 
Then the values assigned to the $s$ and $t$ texture coordinates are
.P
.ce 1
$s ~=~ f sub x over m ~+~ 1 over 2$
.sp
.ce 1
$t ~=~ f sub y over m ~+~ 1 over 2$
.P
To enable or disable a texture-coordinate generation function, call
_cmnd(Enable) or _cmnd(Disable)
with one of the symbolic texture-coordinate names
(_const(TEXTURE_GEN_S),
_const(TEXTURE_GEN_T),
_const(TEXTURE_GEN_R), or
_const(TEXTURE_GEN_Q)) as the argument. 
When enabled,
the specified texture coordinate is computed
according to the generating function associated with that coordinate. 
When disabled,
subsequent vertices take the specified texture coordinate
from the current set of texture coordinates. Initially, all texture
generation functions are set to _const(EYE_LINEAR) and are disabled.
Both $s$ plane equations are (1, 0, 0, 0),
both $t$ plane equations are (0, 1, 0, 0),
and all $r$ and $q$ plane equations are (0, 0, 0, 0).
.P
When the _arbstring(multitexture) extension is supported, _cmnd set the
texture generation parameters for the currently active texture unit,
selected with _cmnd(ActiveTextureARB).
.SH ERRORS
_const(INVALID_ENUM) is generated when _param1 or _param2 is not an
accepted defined value,
or when _param2 is _const(TEXTURE_GEN_MODE) and _param3 is not an
accepted defined value.
.P
_const(INVALID_ENUM) is generated when _param2 is _const(TEXTURE_GEN_MODE),
_param3 is _const(SPHERE_MAP),
and _param1 is either _const(R) or _const(Q).
.P
_const(INVALID_OPERATION) is generated if _cmnd
is executed between the execution of _cmnd(Begin)
and the corresponding execution of _cmnd(End).

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

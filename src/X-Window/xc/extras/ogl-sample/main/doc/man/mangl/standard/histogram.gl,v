_const(RGB5_A1),
_const(RGBA8),
_const(RGB10_A2),
_const(RGBA12), or
_const(RGBA16).
_phead(__sink)
If _const(TRUE), pixels will be consumed by the histogramming
process and no drawing or texture loading will take place.
If _const(FALSE), pixels will proceed to the minmax process after
histogramming.
.SH DESCRIPTION
When _const(HISTOGRAM) is enabled, RGBA color components are converted to
histogram table indices by clamping to the range [0,1], multiplying by
the width of the histogram table, and rounding to the nearest integer.
The table entries selected by the RGBA indices are then incremented.
(If the internal format of the histogram table includes luminance, then
the index derived from the R color component determines the luminance
table entry to be incremented.)  If a histogram table entry is incremented
beyond its maximum value, then its value becomes undefined.  (This is
not an error.)
.PP
Histogramming is performed only for RGBA pixels (though these may
be specified originally as color indices and converted to RGBA by
index table lookup).
Histogramming is enabled with _cmnd(Enable) and disabled with _cmnd(Disable).
.PP
When __target is _const(HISTOGRAM), _cmnd redefines the current
histogram table to have __width entries of the format specified by
__internalformat.
The entries are indexed 0 through $_eqnparam2 ~-~ 1$, and
all entries are initialized to zero.
The values in the previous histogram table, if any, are lost.
If __sink is _const(TRUE), then pixels are discarded after histogramming;
no further processing of the pixels takes place, and no drawing,
texture loading, or pixel readback will result.
.PP
When __target is _const(PROXY_HISTOGRAM), _cmnd computes all
state information as if the histogram table were to be redefined,
but does not actually define the new table.
If the requested histogram table is too large to be supported, then the
state information will be set to zero.
This provides a way to determine if a histogram table with the given
parameters can be supported.
.PP
.SH NOTES
_cmnd is present only if _arbstring(imaging) is returned when _cmnd(GetString)
is called with an argument of _const(EXTENSIONS).
.SH ERRORS
_const(INVALID_ENUM) is generated if __target is not one of the allowable
values.
.P
_const(INVALID_VALUE) is generated if __width is less than zero or is
not a power of 2.
.P
_const(INVALID_ENUM) is generated if __internalformat is not one of the
allowable values.
.P
_const(TABLE_TOO_LARGE) is generated if __target is _const(HISTOGRAM)
and the histogram table specified is too large for the implementation.
.P
_const(INVALID_OPERATION) is generated if _cmnd is executed
between the execution of _cmnd(Begin) and the corresponding
execution of _cmnd(End).

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

_phead(__x)
The x coordinate of the lower-left corner of the pixel rectangle

_phead(__y)
The y coordinate of the lower-left corner of the pixel rectangle
to be transferred to the color table.
_phead(__width)
The width of the pixel rectangle.
.SH DESCRIPTION
_cmnd loads a color table with pixels from the current
_const(READ_BUFFER) (rather than from main memory, as is the case for
_cmnd(ColorTable)).
.P
The screen-aligned pixel rectangle with lower-left corner at (__x,\ __y)
having width __width and height 1
is loaded into the color table. If any pixels within
this region are outside the window that is associated with the GL
context, the values obtained for those pixels are undefined.
.P
The pixels in the rectangle are processed just as if
_cmnd(ReadPixels) were called, with __internalformat set to RGBA, 
but processing stops after the final conversion to RGBA.
.P
The four scale parameters and the four bias parameters that are defined
for the table are then used to scale and bias the R, G, B, and A components
of each pixel. The scale and bias parameters are set by calling
_cmnd(ColorTableParameter).
.P
Next, the R, G, B, and A values are clamped to the range [0,1].
Each pixel is then converted to the internal format specified by
__internalformat. This conversion simply maps the component values of the pixel (R, G, B,
and A) to the values included in the internal format (red, green, blue,
alpha, luminance, and intensity).  The mapping is as follows:
.P
.TS
center;
lb cb cb cb cb cb cb
l c c c c c c.
_
Internal Format	Red	Green	Blue	Alpha	Luminance	Intensity
_
_const(ALPHA)				A
_const(LUMINANCE)					R
_const(LUMINANCE_ALPHA)				A	R
_const(INTENSITY)						R
_const(RGB)	R	G	B
_const(RGBA)	R	G	B	A
_
.TE
.P
Finally, the red, green, blue, alpha, luminance, and/or intensity components of
the resulting pixels are stored in the color table.
They form a one-dimensional table with indices in the range
[0,\ __width\ \-\ 1].
.P
.SH NOTES
_cmnd is available only if _arbstring(imaging) is returned from calling
_cmnd(GetString) with an argument of _const(EXTENSIONS).
.SH ERRORS
_const(INVALID_ENUM) is generated when __target is not one of the
allowable values.
.P
_const(INVALID_VALUE) is generated if __width is less than zero.
.P
_const(INVALID_VALUE) is generated if __internalformat is not one of the
allowable values.
.P
_const(TABLE_TOO_LARGE) is generated if the requested color table
is too large to be supported by the implementation.
.P
_const(INVALID_OPERATION) is generated if _cmnd is executed
between the execution of _cmnd(Begin) and the corresponding
execution of _cmnd(End).

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

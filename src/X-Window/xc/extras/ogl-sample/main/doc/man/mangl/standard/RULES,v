@remove a bunch of files not used in MirBSD - clean tree. People who want them got cvs.

@Rules for Open GL man pages:

    *	Describe commands that differ only by a suffix on the same
	page.  Do this regardless of whether the commands take the
	same or different arguments.  For example, all 24 Vertex
	commands are described on one page.

	Issue - current tools like to separate v and non-v commands.

    *	Describe commands that operate in obvious pairs on the same
	page.  For example, Begin and End, or PushMatrix and PopMatrix.

    *	Use the _header(desc) macro to begin a manpage.  Write the
	1-line command description "desc" using the imperative tense.
	For example:

		_header(Operate on the accumulation buffer)
		
	not
		_header(Operates on the accumulation buffer)

    *	The order of the entries on a manpage is

		header
		PARAMETERS (unless the command takes no parameters)
		DESCRIPTION
		EXAMPLE (optional)
		ERRORS (optional)
		SEE ALSO
		BUGS (optional)
		NOTES (optional)

    *	Use the _phead(param) macro to describe each parameter or
	group of parameters.

    *	Begin the description of in-only parameters with the phrase
	"Specifies".

    *	Begin the description of out-only parameters with the phrase
	"Returns".

    *	Begin the description of in-and-out parameters with the
	phrase "Specifies and returns".  If there is a difference
	between what is specified and what is returned, use two
	paragraphs for the description, the first beginning with
	"Specifies" and the second beginning with "Returns".

    *	Group like parameters into a single description.  For example
	"x,y  Specify the x and y coordinates ...", or
	"r,g,b  Return the red, green, and blue color values ..."

	Possible tools issue.

    *	Include the default value in the description of parameters
	that directly specify GL state.

    *	Refer to parameters using the _param# macro, never explicitly
	by name.  Note that this rules out clever English tricks that
	count on the macro evaluating to a particular string.  For
	example, one cannot say "The second parameter is a floating
	point _param2", where it is expected that _param2 will evaluate
	to the string "value".

    *	Use _cmnd to refer to the command being described.

    *	Use _cmnd(basename) to refer to another command.  Note that
	basename does not include any prefix, it is added automatically
	by the _cmnd() macro.

    *	Use _const(basename) to refer to a constant.  Note that
	basename does not include any prefix, it is added automatically
	by the _const() macro.

    *	Use _hex(value) to refer to a hexidecimal value.
	(This should not be required very often in the Open GL.)

    *	List commands in the see also section in alphabetical order.
	Include commands that return all the state that is set by
	the command being documented.

Limitations of the alpha release:

    *	The header, command syntax, parameter descriptions, and see
	also sections will be complete.

    *	The command description may not be complete, but it will at
	least exist.

    *	The example section may not exist.

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

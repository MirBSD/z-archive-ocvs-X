.SH PARAMETERS
_phead(__target)
Must be
_const(MINMAX).
_phead(__pname)
The parameter to be retrieved.
Must be one of
_const(MINMAX_FORMAT) or
_const(MINMAX_SINK).
_phead(__params)
A pointer to storage for the retrieved parameters.
.SH DESCRIPTION
_cmnd retrieves parameters for the current minmax table by setting
__pname to one of the following values:
.sp

.TS
center;
lb lb
l l.
_
Parameter	Description
_
_const(MINMAX_FORMAT)	Internal format of minmax table
_const(MINMAX_SINK)	Value of the \f2sink\fP parameter
_
.TE

.SH NOTES
_cmnd is present only if _arbstring(imaging) is returned when _cmnd(GetString)
is called with an argument of _const(EXTENSIONS).
.SH ERRORS
_const(INVALID_ENUM) is generated if __target is not _const(MINMAX).
.P
_const(INVALID_ENUM) is generated if __pname is not one of the allowable
values.
.P
_const(INVALID_OPERATION) is generated if _cmnd is executed
between the execution of _cmnd(Begin) and the corresponding
execution of _cmnd(End).

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

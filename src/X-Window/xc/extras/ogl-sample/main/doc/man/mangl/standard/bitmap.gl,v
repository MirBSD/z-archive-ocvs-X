.SH PARAMETERS
_phead(_param1 _param2)
Specify the pixel width and height of the bitmap image.
_phead(_param3 _param4)
Specify the location of the origin in the bitmap image.
The origin is measured from the lower left corner of the bitmap,
with right and up being the positive axes.
_phead(_param5 _param6)
Specify the \f2x\fP and \f2y\fP offsets to be added to the current raster position
after the bitmap is drawn.
_phead(_param7)
Specifies the address of the bitmap image.
.SH DESCRIPTION
A bitmap is a binary image.
When drawn,
the bitmap is positioned relative to the current raster position,
and frame buffer pixels corresponding to 1's in the bitmap are
written using the current raster color or index.
Frame buffer pixels corresponding to 0's in the bitmap are not modified.
.P
_cmnd takes seven arguments.
The first pair specifies the width and height of the bitmap image.
The second pair specifies the location of the bitmap origin relative
to the lower left corner of the bitmap image.
The third pair of arguments specifies \f2x\fP and \f2y\fP offsets to be added
to the current raster position after the bitmap has been drawn.
The final argument is a pointer to the bitmap image itself.
.P
The bitmap image is interpreted like image data for the _cmnd(DrawPixels)
command,
with _param1 and _param2 corresponding to the width and height arguments
of that command,
and with \f2type\fP set to _const(BITMAP)
and \f2format\fP set to _const(COLOR_INDEX).
.BP
Modes specified using _cmnd(PixelStore) affect the
interpretation of bitmap image data;
modes specified using _cmnd(PixelTransfer) do not.
.P
If the current raster position is invalid, _cmnd is ignored.
Otherwise,
the lower left corner of the bitmap image is positioned at the window coordinates
.ce
.sp
$ x sub w ~=~ \(lf ~ x sub r ~-~ x sub o ~ \(rf $
.br
.sp
.ce
$ y sub w ~=~ \(lf ~ y sub r ~-~ y sub o ~ \(rf $
.sp
where $ ( x sub r , y sub r ) $ is the raster position
and $ ( x sub o , y sub o ) $ is the bitmap origin.
Fragments are then generated for each pixel corresponding to a 1 (one)
in the bitmap image.
These fragments are generated using the current raster \f2z\fP coordinate,
color or color index, and current raster texture coordinates.
They are then treated just as if they had been generated
by a point, line, or polygon,
including texture mapping,
.br
fogging,
and all per-fragment operations such as alpha and depth testing.
.P
After the bitmap has been drawn,
the \f2x\fP and \f2y\fP coordinates of the current raster position are offset by
_param5 and _param6.
No change is made to the \f2z\fP coordinate of the current raster position,
or to the current raster color, texture coordinates, or index.
.SH NOTES
To set a valid raster position outside the viewport, first set a valid
raster position inside the viewport, then call _cmnd(Bitmap) with NULL
as the _param7 parameter and with _param5 and _param6 set to
the offsets of the new raster position. This technique is useful when
panning an image around the viewport. 
.SH ERRORS
_const(INVALID_VALUE) is generated if _param1 or _param2 is negative.
.P
_const(INVALID_OPERATION) is generated if _cmnd
is executed between the execution of _cmnd(Begin) and the corresponding execution of
_cmnd(End).
.SH ASSOCIATED GETS
_cmnd(Get) with argument _const(CURRENT_RASTER_POSITION)
.br
_cmnd(Get) with argument _const(CURRENT_RASTER_COLOR)
.br

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

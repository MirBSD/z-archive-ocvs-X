.SH PARAMETERS
_phead(_param1)
Specifies the symbolic name of the target texture,
either _const(TEXTURE_1D), _const(TEXTURE_2D), _const(TEXTURE_3D),
_const(PROXY_TEXTURE_1D), _const(PROXY_TEXTURE_2D), or
_const(PROXY_TEXTURE_3D).
_phead(_param2)
Specifies the level-of-detail number of the desired image.
Level 0 is the base image level.
Level $n$ is the $n$th mipmap reduction image.
_phead(_param3)
Specifies the symbolic name of a texture parameter.
_const(TEXTURE_WIDTH),
_const(TEXTURE_HEIGHT),
_const(TEXTURE_DEPTH),
_const(TEXTURE_INTERNAL_FORMAT),
_const(TEXTURE_BORDER),
_const(TEXTURE_RED_SIZE),
_const(TEXTURE_GREEN_SIZE),
_const(TEXTURE_BLUE_SIZE),
_const(TEXTURE_ALPHA_SIZE),
_const(TEXTURE_LUMINANCE_SIZE), and
_const(TEXTURE_INTENSITY_SIZE) are accepted.
_phead(_param4)
Returns the requested data.
.SH DESCRIPTION
_cmnd returns in _param4 texture parameter values for a specific 
level-of-detail value,
specified as _param2.
_param1 defines the target texture,
either _const(TEXTURE_1D), _const(TEXTURE_2D), _const(TEXTURE_3D),
_const(PROXY_TEXTURE_1D), 
_const(PROXY_TEXTURE_2D), or
_const(PROXY_TEXTURE_3D).
.BR
.P
_const(MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE), and _const(MAX_3D_TEXTURE_SIZE) are not really
descriptive enough.
It has to report the largest square texture image that can be
accommodated with mipmaps and borders, 
but a long skinny texture, or a texture without mipmaps and borders, may
easily fit in texture memory. 
The proxy targets allow the user to more accurately query
whether the GL can accommodate a texture of a given configuration.
If the texture cannot be accommodated, the texture state variables, which
may be queried with _cmnd, are set to 0.  If the texture can be accommodated,
the texture state values will be set as they would be set for a
non-proxy target.
.P
_param3 specifies the texture parameter whose value or values
will be returned.
.P
The accepted parameter names are as follows:
.TP 10
_const(TEXTURE_WIDTH)
_param4 returns a single value,
the width of the texture image.
This value includes the border of the texture image. The initial value is
0. 
.TP
_const(TEXTURE_HEIGHT)
_param4 returns a single value,
the height of the texture image.
This value includes the border of the texture image. The initial value is
0.
.TP
_const(TEXTURE_DEPTH)
_param4 returns a single value,
the depth of the texture image.
This value includes the border of the texture image. The initial value is
0.
.TP
_const(TEXTURE_INTERNAL_FORMAT)
_param4 returns a single value,
the internal format of the texture image. 
.TP
_const(TEXTURE_BORDER)
_param4 returns a single value,
the width in pixels of the border of the texture image. The initial value
is 0. 
.TP
_const(TEXTURE_RED_SIZE),
.TP
_const(TEXTURE_GREEN_SIZE),
.TP
_const(TEXTURE_BLUE_SIZE),
.TP
_const(TEXTURE_ALPHA_SIZE),
.TP
_const(TEXTURE_LUMINANCE_SIZE), 
.TP
_const(TEXTURE_INTENSITY_SIZE)
The internal storage resolution of an individual component.
The resolution chosen by the GL will be a close match for the resolution
requested by the user with the component argument of _cmnd(TexImage1D),
_cmnd(TexImage2D), _cmnd(TexImage3D), _cmnd(CopyTexImage1D), and
_cmnd(CopyTexImage2D). The initial value is 0. 
.SH NOTES
If an error is generated,
no change is made to the contents of _param4.
.P
_const(TEXTURE_INTERNAL_FORMAT) is available only if the GL version is
1.1 or greater. In version 1.0, use _const(TEXTURE_COMPONENTS)
instead.
.P
_const(PROXY_TEXTURE_1D) and _const(PROXY_TEXTURE_2D) are 
available only if the GL version is 1.1 or greater.
.P
_const(TEXTURE_3D), _const(PROXY_TEXTURE_3D), and _const(TEXTURE_DEPTH)
are available only if the GL version is 1.2 or greater.
.P
When the _arbstring(multitexture) extension is supported, _cmnd returns
the texture level parameters for the active texture unit.
.SH ERRORS
_const(INVALID_ENUM) is generated if _param1 or _param3 is not an
accepted value.
.P
_const(INVALID_VALUE) is generated if _param2 is less than 0.
.P 
_const(INVALID_VALUE) may be generated if _param2 is greater
than $ log sub 2$ \f2max\fP,
where \f2max\fP is the returned value of _const(MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE).
.P
_const(INVALID_OPERATION) is generated if _cmnd
is executed between the execution of _cmnd(Begin)
and the corresponding execution of _cmnd(End).

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

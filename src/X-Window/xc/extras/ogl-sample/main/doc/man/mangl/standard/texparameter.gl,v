.SH DESCRIPTION
Texture mapping is a technique that applies an image onto an object's surface
as if the image were a decal or cellophane shrink-wrap. 
The image is created in texture space,
with an ($s$, $t$) coordinate system. 
A texture is a one- or two-dimensional image and a set of parameters
that determine how samples are derived from the image.
.P
_cmnd assigns the value or values in _param3 to the texture parameter
specified as _param2. 
_param1 defines the target texture,
either _const(TEXTURE_1D), _const(TEXTURE_2D), or _const(TEXTURE_3D).
The following symbols are accepted in _param2:
.TP 10
_const(TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER)
The texture minifying function is used whenever the pixel being textured
maps to an area greater than one texture element. 
There are six defined minifying functions.
Two of them use the nearest one or nearest four texture elements
to compute the texture value. 
The other four use mipmaps.
.IP
A mipmap is an ordered set of arrays representing the same image
at progressively lower resolutions. 
If the texture has dimensions $2 sup n ~times~ 2 sup m$, there are
$ bold max ( n, m ) + 1 $ mipmaps. 
The first mipmap is the original texture,
with dimensions $2 sup n ~times~ 2 sup m$. 
Each subsequent mipmap has dimensions $2 sup { k - 1 } ~times~ 2 sup { l - 1 }$,
where $2 sup k ~times~ 2 sup l$ are the dimensions of the previous mipmap,
until either $k ~=~ 0$ or $l~=~0$.
At that point,
subsequent mipmaps have dimension $ 1 ~times~ 2 sup { l - 1 } $
or $ 2 sup { k - 1} ~times~ 1 $ until the final mipmap,
which has dimension $1 ~times~ 1$. 
To define the mipmaps, call _cmnd(TexImage1D), _cmnd(TexImage2D),
_cmnd(TexImage3D), 
_cmnd(CopyTexImage1D), or _cmnd(CopyTexImage2D)
with the \f2level\fP argument indicating the order of the mipmaps.
Level 0 is the original texture;
level $ bold max ( n, m ) $ is the final $1 ~times~ 1$ mipmap.
.IP
_param3 supplies a function for minifying the texture as one of the following:
.RS 10
.TP 10
_const(NEAREST)
Returns the value of the texture element that is nearest
(in Manhattan distance)
to the center of the pixel being textured.
.TP
_const(LINEAR)
Returns the weighted average of the four texture elements
that are closest to the center of the pixel being textured.
These can include border texture elements,
depending on the values of _const(TEXTURE_WRAP_S) and _const(TEXTURE_WRAP_T),
and on the exact mapping.
.TP
_const(NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST)
Chooses the mipmap that most closely matches the size of the pixel
being textured and uses the _const(NEAREST) criterion
(the texture element nearest to the center of the pixel)
to produce a texture value.
.TP
_const(LINEAR_MIPMAP_NEAREST)
Chooses the mipmap that most closely matches the size of the pixel
being textured and uses the _const(LINEAR) criterion
(a weighted average of the four texture elements that are closest
to the center of the pixel)
to produce a texture value.
.TP
_const(NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR)
Chooses the two mipmaps that most closely match the size of the pixel
being textured and uses the _const(NEAREST) criterion
(the texture element nearest to the center of the pixel)
to produce a texture value from each mipmap. 
The final texture value is a weighted average of those two values.
.TP
_const(LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR)
Chooses the two mipmaps that most closely match the size of the pixel
being textured and uses the _const(LINEAR) criterion
(a weighted average of the four texture elements that are closest
to the center of the pixel)
to produce a texture value from each mipmap.
The final texture value is a weighted average of those two values.
.RE
.IP
As more texture elements are sampled in the minification process,
fewer aliasing artifacts will be apparent. 
While the _const(NEAREST) and _const(LINEAR) minification functions can be
faster than the other four,
they sample only one or four texture elements to determine the texture value
of the pixel being rendered and can produce moire patterns
or ragged transitions. 
The initial value of _const(TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER) is
_const(NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR).
.TP 10
_const(TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER)
The texture magnification function is used when the pixel being textured
maps to an area less than or equal to one texture element.
It sets the texture magnification function to either _const(NEAREST)
or _const(LINEAR) (see below). _const(NEAREST) is generally faster
than _const(LINEAR), 
but it can produce textured images with sharper edges
because the transition between texture elements is not as smooth. 
The initial value of _const(TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER) is _const(LINEAR).
.RS 10
.TP 10
_const(NEAREST)
Returns the value of the texture element that is nearest
(in Manhattan distance)
to the center of the pixel being textured.
.TP
_const(LINEAR)
Returns the weighted average of the four texture elements
that are closest to the center of the pixel being textured.
These can include border texture elements,
depending on the values of _const(TEXTURE_WRAP_S) and _const(TEXTURE_WRAP_T),
and on the exact mapping.
.P
.RE
.P
.TP 10
_const(TEXTURE_MIN_LOD)
Sets the minimum level-of-detail parameter.  This floating-point value
limits the selection of highest resolution mipmap (lowest mipmap
level). The initial value is -1000.
.P
.TP 10
_const(TEXTURE_MAX_LOD)
Sets the maximum level-of-detail parameter.  This floating-point value
limits the selection of the lowest resolution mipmap (highest mipmap
level). The initial value is 1000.
.P
.TP 10
_const(TEXTURE_BASE_LEVEL)
Specifies the index of the lowest defined mipmap level. This is an
integer value. The initial value is 0.
.P
.TP 10
_const(TEXTURE_MAX_LEVEL)
Sets the index of the highest defined mipmap level. This is an integer
value. The initial value is 1000.
.P
.TP 10
_const(TEXTURE_WRAP_S)
Sets the wrap parameter for texture coordinate $s$ to either
_const(CLAMP), _const(CLAMP_TO_EDGE), or _const(REPEAT).
_const(CLAMP) causes $s$ coordinates to be clamped to the range [0,1]
and is useful for preventing wrapping artifacts when mapping
a single image onto an object.
_const(CLAMP_TO_EDGE) causes $s$ coordinates to be clamped to the range
$left [ {1 over 2N}, 1 - {1 over 2N} right ]$, where $N$ is the size
of the texture in the direction of clamping.
_const(REPEAT) causes the integer part of the $s$ coordinate to be ignored;
the GL uses only the fractional part,
thereby creating a repeating pattern. 
Border texture elements are accessed only if wrapping is set to _const(CLAMP).
Initially, _const(TEXTURE_WRAP_S) is set to _const(REPEAT).
.P
.TP 10
_const(TEXTURE_WRAP_T)
Sets the wrap parameter for texture coordinate $t$ to either
_const(CLAMP), _const(CLAMP_TO_EDGE), or _const(REPEAT).
See the discussion under _const(TEXTURE_WRAP_S). 
Initially, _const(TEXTURE_WRAP_T) is set to _const(REPEAT).
.TP 10
_const(TEXTURE_WRAP_R)
Sets the wrap parameter for texture coordinate $r$ to either
_const(CLAMP), _const(CLAMP_TO_EDGE), or _const(REPEAT).
See the discussion under _const(TEXTURE_WRAP_S). 
Initially, _const(TEXTURE_WRAP_R) is set to _const(REPEAT).
.TP
_const(TEXTURE_BORDER_COLOR)
Sets a border color.
_param3 contains four values that comprise the RGBA color
of the texture border. 
Integer color components are interpreted linearly such that the most
positive integer maps to 1.0,
and the most negative integer maps to -1.0.
The values are clamped to the range [0,1] when they are specified.
Initially, the border color is (0, 0, 0, 0).
.TP 10
_const(TEXTURE_PRIORITY)
Specifies the texture residence priority of the currently bound texture.
Permissible values are in the range [0,\ 1].
See _cmnd(PrioritizeTextures) and _cmnd(BindTexture) for more information.
.SH NOTES
_const(TEXTURE_3D), _const(TEXTURE_MIN_LOD), _const(TEXTURE_MAX_LOD),
_const(TEXTURE_BASE_LEVEL), and _const(TEXTURE_MAX_LEVEL) are only
available if the GL version is 1.2 or greater.
.P
Suppose that a program has enabled texturing
(by calling _cmnd(Enable)
with argument _const(TEXTURE_1D), _const(TEXTURE_2D), or _const(TEXTURE_3D))
and has set _const(TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER) to one of the functions
that requires a mipmap.
If either the dimensions of the texture images currently defined
(with previous calls to _cmnd(TexImage1D), _cmnd(TexImage2D), 
_cmnd(TexImage3D),
_cmnd(CopyTexImage1D), or _cmnd(CopyTexImage2D)) 
do not follow the proper sequence for mipmaps
(described above),
or there are fewer texture images defined than are needed,
or the set of texture images have differing numbers of texture components,
then it is as if texture mapping were disabled. 
.P
Linear filtering accesses the four nearest texture elements only in 2D
textures.
In 1D textures, linear filtering accesses the two nearest texture
elements.
.P
When the _arbstring(multitexture) extension is supported, _cmnd
specifies the texture parameters for the active texture unit, specified
by calling _cmnd(ActiveTextureARB).
.SH ERRORS
_const(INVALID_ENUM) is generated if _param1 or _param2 is not
one of the accepted defined values.
.P
_const(INVALID_ENUM) is generated if _param3 should have a defined
constant value (based on the value of _param2) and does not.
.P
_const(INVALID_OPERATION) is generated if _cmnd
is executed between the execution of _cmnd(Begin)
and the corresponding execution of _cmnd(End).

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

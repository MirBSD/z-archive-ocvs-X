.EQ

.EN
.SH PARAMETERS
_phead(_param1)
Specifies the diameter of rasterized points.
The initial value is 1.
.SH DESCRIPTION
_cmnd specifies the rasterized diameter of both aliased and antialiased
points.
Using a point size other than 1 has different effects,
depending on whether point antialiasing is enabled.
To enable and disable point antialiasing, call 
_cmnd(Enable) and _cmnd(Disable)
with argument _const(POINT_SMOOTH). Point antialiasing is initially disabled.
.P
If point antialiasing is disabled,
the actual size is determined by rounding the supplied size
to the nearest integer.
(If the rounding results in the value 0,
it is as if the point size were 1.)
If the rounded size is odd,
then the center point
($ x $, $ y $)
of the pixel fragment that represents the point is computed as
.sp
.ce
( $ \(lf ~ x sub w ~ \(rf ~+~ .5 $, $ \(lf ~ y sub w ~ \(rf ~+~ .5 $)
.sp
where $w$ subscripts indicate window coordinates.
All pixels that lie within the square grid of the rounded size centered at
($ x $, $ y $)
make up the fragment.
If the size is even,
the center point is
.sp
.ce
( $ \(lf ~ x sub w ~+~ .5 ~ \(rf$, $ \(lf ~ y sub w ~+~ .5 ~ \(rf $)
.sp
and the rasterized fragment's centers are the half-integer window coordinates
within the square of the rounded size centered at
($ x $, $ y $).
All pixel fragments produced in rasterizing a nonantialiased point are
assigned the same associated data,
that of the vertex corresponding to the point.
.P
If antialiasing is enabled,
then point rasterization produces a fragment for each pixel square
that intersects the region lying within the circle having diameter
equal to the current point size and centered at the point's
($ x sub w $, $ y sub w $).
The coverage value for each fragment is the window coordinate area
of the intersection of the circular region with the corresponding pixel square.
This value is saved and used in the final rasterization step. 
The data associated with each fragment is the data associated with 
the point being rasterized.
.P
Not all sizes are supported when point antialiasing is enabled. 
If an unsupported size is requested,
the nearest supported size is used.
Only size 1 is guaranteed to be supported;
others depend on the implementation.
To query the range of supported sizes and the size difference between
supported sizes within the range, call
_cmnd(Get) with arguments
_const(SMOOTH_POINT_SIZE_RANGE) and
_const(SMOOTH_POINT_SIZE_GRANULARITY).
For aliased points, query the supported ranges and granularity with
_cmnd(Get) with arguments
_const(ALIASED_POINT_SIZE_RANGE) and
_const(ALIASED_POINT_SIZE_GRANULARITY).
.SH NOTES
The point size specified by _cmnd is always returned when _const(POINT_SIZE)
is queried.
Clamping and rounding for aliased and antialiased points have no effect
on the specified value.
.P
A non-antialiased point size may be clamped to an implementation-dependent
maximum.
Although this maximum cannot be queried,
it must be no less than the maximum value for antialiased points,
rounded to the nearest integer value.
.P
_const(POINT_SIZE_RANGE) and _const(POINT_SIZE_GRANULARITY) are
deprecated in GL versions 1.2 and greater.  Their functionality has been 
replaced by _const(SMOOTH_POINT_SIZE_RANGE) and 
_const(SMOOTH_POINT_SIZE_GRANULARITY).
.SH ERRORS
_const(INVALID_VALUE) is generated if _param1 is less than or equal to 0.
.P
_const(INVALID_OPERATION) is generated if _cmnd
is executed between the execution of _cmnd(Begin)
and the corresponding execution of _cmnd(End).

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.SH PARAMETERS
_phead(_param1)
Specifies a quadrics object (created with _cmnd(NewQuadric)).
_phead(_param2)
Specifies the inner radius of the partial disk (can be 0).
_phead(_param3)
Specifies the outer radius of the partial disk.
_phead(_param4)
Specifies the number of subdivisions around the \f2z\fP axis.
_phead(_param5)
Specifies the number of concentric rings about the origin into which
the partial disk is subdivided.
_phead(_param6)
Specifies the starting angle, in degrees, of the disk portion.
_phead(_param7)
Specifies the sweep angle, in degrees, of the disk portion.
.SH DESCRIPTION
_cmnd renders a partial disk on the $ z ~=~ 0 $ plane. A partial disk is 
similar to a full disk, except that only the subset of the disk from
_param6 through _param6 + _param7 is included (where 0 degrees is along the 
+\f2y\f axis,
90 degrees along the +\f2x\fP axis, 180 degrees along the \-\f2y\fP axis, and 
270 degrees along the \-\f2x\fP axis).
.P
The partial disk has a radius of 
_param3, and contains a concentric circular hole with a radius 
of _param2. If _param2 is 0, then no hole is generated. The partial disk is
subdivided around the \f2z\fP axis into slices (like pizza slices), and also
about the \f2z\fP axis into rings 
(as specified by _param4 and _param5, respectively).
.P
With respect to orientation, the +\f2z\fP 
side of the partial disk is considered to 
be outside (see _cmnd(QuadricOrientation)).
This means that if the 
orientation is set to _gluconst(OUTSIDE), then any normals generated 
point along the +\f2z\fP axis. Otherwise, they point along the \-\f2z\fP 
axis.
.P
If texturing is turned on (with _cmnd(QuadricTexture)), texture
coordinates are generated
linearly such that where $ r ~=~ _eqnparam3 $, the value at (\f2r\fP, 0, 0) is 
(1.0, 0.5), at (0, \f2r\fP, 0) it is (0.5, 1.0), at (\-\f2r\fP, 0, 0) 
it is (0.0, 0.5), and 
at (0, \-\f2r\fP, 0) it is (0.5, 0.0).

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

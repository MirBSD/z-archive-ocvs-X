_const(UNSIGNED_INT_8_8_8_8_REV),
_const(UNSIGNED_INT_10_10_10_2), and
_const(UNSIGNED_INT_2_10_10_10_REV).
_phead(_param5)
Returns the texture image.
Should be a pointer to an array of the type specified by _param4.
.SH DESCRIPTION
_cmnd returns a texture image into _param5.
_param1 specifies whether the desired texture image is one specified by
_cmnd(TexImage1D) (_const(TEXTURE_1D)),
_cmnd(TexImage2D) (_const(TEXTURE_2D)), or
_cmnd(TexImage3D) (_const(TEXTURE_3D)).
_param2 specifies the level-of-detail number of the desired image.
_param3 and _param4 specify the format and type of the desired image array.
See the reference pages _cmnd(TexImage1D) and _cmnd(DrawPixels)
for a description of the acceptable values for the _param3 and _param4
parameters, respectively.
.P
To understand the operation of _cmnd, consider the selected internal
four-component texture image to be an RGBA color buffer the size of the image.
The semantics of _cmnd are then identical to those of _cmnd(ReadPixels),
with the exception that no pixel transfer operations are performed,
when called with the same _param3 and _param4,
with \f2x\fP and \f2y\fP set to 0,
\f2width\fP set to the width of the texture image
(including border if one was specified),
and \f2height\fP set to 1 for 1D images,
or to the height of the texture image
(including border if one was specified)
for 2D images.
.BP
Because the internal texture image is an RGBA image,
pixel formats _const(COLOR_INDEX),
_const(STENCIL_INDEX),
and _const(DEPTH_COMPONENT) are not accepted,
and pixel type _const(BITMAP) is not accepted.
.P
If the selected texture image does not contain four components,
the following mappings are applied.
Single-component textures are treated as RGBA buffers with red set
to the single-component value,
green set to 0,  blue set to 0, and alpha set to 1.
Two-component textures are treated as RGBA buffers with red set to
the value of component zero,
alpha set to the value of component one,
and green and blue set to 0.
Finally,
three-component textures are treated as RGBA buffers with red set to
component zero,
green set to component one,
blue set to component two,
and alpha set to 1.
.P
To determine the required size of _param5,
use _cmnd(GetTexLevelParameter) to determine the dimensions of the
internal texture image,
then scale the required number of pixels by the storage required for
each pixel,
based on _param3 and _param4.
Be sure to take the pixel storage parameters into account,
especially _const(PACK_ALIGNMENT).
.SH NOTES
If an error is generated,
no change is made to the contents of _param5.
.P
When the _arbstring(multitexture) extension is supported, _cmnd returns
the texture image for the active texture unit.
.P
The types _const(UNSIGNED_BYTE_3_3_2),
_const(UNSIGNED_BYTE_2_3_3_REV),
_const(UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_6_5),
_const(UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_6_5_REV),
_const(UNSIGNED_SHORT_4_4_4_4),
_const(UNSIGNED_SHORT_4_4_4_4_REV),
_const(UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_5_5_1),
_const(UNSIGNED_SHORT_1_5_5_5_REV),
_const(UNSIGNED_INT_8_8_8_8),
_const(UNSIGNED_INT_8_8_8_8_REV),
_const(UNSIGNED_INT_10_10_10_2), 
_const(UNSIGNED_INT_2_10_10_10_REV), 
and the formats
_const(BGR), and _const(BGRA) are available only if the GL version is
1.2 or greater.
.SH ERRORS
_const(INVALID_ENUM) is generated if _param1, _param3, or _param4 is not
an accepted value.
.P
_const(INVALID_VALUE) is generated if _param2 is less than 0.
.P 
_const(INVALID_VALUE) may be generated if _param2 is greater
than $log sub 2 max$,
where $max$ is the returned value of _const(MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE).
.P
_const(INVALID_OPERATION) is generated if _cmnd
is executed between the execution of _cmnd(Begin)
and the corresponding execution of _cmnd(End).
.P
_const(INVALID_OPERATION) is returned if _param4 is one of
_const(UNSIGNED_BYTE_3_3_2),
_const(UNSIGNED_BYTE_2_3_3_REV),
_const(UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_6_5), or
_const(UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_6_5_REV) and _param3 is not _const(RGB).
.P
_const(INVALID_OPERATION) is returned if _param4 is one of
_const(UNSIGNED_SHORT_4_4_4_4),
_const(UNSIGNED_SHORT_4_4_4_4_REV),
_const(UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_5_5_1),
_const(UNSIGNED_SHORT_1_5_5_5_REV),
_const(UNSIGNED_INT_8_8_8_8),
_const(UNSIGNED_INT_8_8_8_8_REV),
_const(UNSIGNED_INT_10_10_10_2), or
_const(UNSIGNED_INT_2_10_10_10_REV), and _param3 is neither _const(RGBA) 
or _const(BGRA).

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

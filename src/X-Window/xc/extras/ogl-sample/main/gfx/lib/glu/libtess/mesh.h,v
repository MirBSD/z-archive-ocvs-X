/* The mesh structure is similar in spirit, notation, and operations
 * to the "quad-edge" structure (see L. Guibas and J. Stolfi, Primitives
 * for the manipulation of general subdivisions and the computation of
 * Voronoi diagrams, ACM Transactions on Graphics, 4(2):74-123, April 1985).
 * For a simplified description, see the course notes for CS348a,
 * "Mathematical Foundations of Computer Graphics", available at the
 * Stanford bookstore (and taught during the fall quarter).
 * The implementation also borrows a tiny subset of the graph-based approach
 * use in Mantyla's Geometric Work Bench (see M. Mantyla, An Introduction
 * to Sold Modeling, Computer Science Press, Rockville, Maryland, 1988).
 *
 * The fundamental data structure is the "half-edge".  Two half-edges
 * go together to make an edge, but they point in opposite directions.
 * Each half-edge has a pointer to its mate (the "symmetric" half-edge Sym),
 * its origin vertex (Org), the face on its left side (Lface), and the
 * adjacent half-edges in the CCW direction around the origin vertex
 * (Onext) and around the left face (Lnext).  There is also a "next"
 * pointer for the global edge list (see below).
 *
 * The notation used for mesh navigation:
 *	Sym   = the mate of a half-edge (same edge, but opposite direction)
 *	Onext = edge CCW around origin vertex (keep same origin)
 *	Dnext = edge CCW around destination vertex (keep same dest)
 *	Lnext = edge CCW around left face (dest becomes new origin)
 *	Rnext = edge CCW around right face (origin becomes new dest)
 *
 * "prev" means to substitute CW for CCW in the definitions above.
 *
 * The mesh keeps global lists of all vertices, faces, and edges,
 * stored as doubly-linked circular lists with a dummy header node.
 * The mesh stores pointers to these dummy headers (vHead, fHead, eHead).
 *
 * The circular edge list is special; since half-edges always occur
 * in pairs (e and e->Sym), each half-edge stores a pointer in only
 * one direction.  Starting at eHead and following the e->next pointers
 * will visit each *edge* once (ie. e or e->Sym, but not both).
 * e->Sym stores a pointer in the opposite direction, thus it is
 * always true that e->Sym->next->Sym->next == e.
 *
 * Each vertex has a pointer to next and previous vertices in the
 * circular list, and a pointer to a half-edge with this vertex as
 * the origin (NULL if this is the dummy header).  There is also a
 * field "data" for client data.
 *
 * Each face has a pointer to the next and previous faces in the
 * circular list, and a pointer to a half-edge with this face as
 * the left face (NULL if this is the dummy header).  There is also
 * a field "data" for client data.
 *
 * Note that what we call a "face" is really a loop; faces may consist
 * of more than one loop (ie. not simply connected), but there is no
 * record of this in the data structure.  The mesh may consist of
 * several disconnected regions, so it may not be possible to visit
 * the entire mesh by starting at a half-edge and traversing the edge
 * structure.
 *
 * The mesh does NOT support isolated vertices; a vertex is deleted along
 * with its last edge.  Similarly when two faces are merged, one of the
 * faces is deleted (see __gl_meshDelete below).  For mesh operations,
 * all face (loop) and vertex pointers must not be NULL.  However, once
 * mesh manipulation is finished, __gl_MeshZapFace can be used to delete
 * faces of the mesh, one at a time.  All external faces can be "zapped"
 * before the mesh is returned to the client; then a NULL face indicates
 * a region which is not part of the output polygon.

/* The mesh operations below have three motivations: completeness,
 * convenience, and efficiency.  The basic mesh operations are MakeEdge,
 * Splice, and Delete.  All the other edge operations can be implemented
 * in terms of these.  The other operations are provided for convenience
 * and/or efficiency.
 *
 * When a face is split or a vertex is added, they are inserted into the
 * global list *before* the existing vertex or face (ie. e->Org or e->Lface).
 * This makes it easier to process all vertices or faces in the global lists
 * without worrying about processing the same data twice.  As a convenience,
 * when a face is split, the "inside" flag is copied from the old face.
 * Other internal data (v->data, v->activeRegion, f->data, f->marked,
 * f->trail, e->winding) is set to zero.
 *
 * ********************** Basic Edge Operations **************************
 *
 * __gl_meshMakeEdge( mesh ) creates one edge, two vertices, and a loop.
 * The loop (face) consists of the two new half-edges.
 *
 * __gl_meshSplice( eOrg, eDst ) is the basic operation for changing the
 * mesh connectivity and topology.  It changes the mesh so that
 *	eOrg->Onext <- OLD( eDst->Onext )
 *	eDst->Onext <- OLD( eOrg->Onext )
 * where OLD(...) means the value before the meshSplice operation.
 *
 * This can have two effects on the vertex structure:
 *  - if eOrg->Org != eDst->Org, the two vertices are merged together
 *  - if eOrg->Org == eDst->Org, the origin is split into two vertices
 * In both cases, eDst->Org is changed and eOrg->Org is untouched.
 *
 * Similarly (and independently) for the face structure,
 *  - if eOrg->Lface == eDst->Lface, one loop is split into two
 *  - if eOrg->Lface != eDst->Lface, two distinct loops are joined into one
 * In both cases, eDst->Lface is changed and eOrg->Lface is unaffected.
 *
 * __gl_meshDelete( eDel ) removes the edge eDel.  There are several cases:
 * if (eDel->Lface != eDel->Rface), we join two loops into one; the loop
 * eDel->Lface is deleted.  Otherwise, we are splitting one loop into two;
 * the newly created loop will contain eDel->Dst.  If the deletion of eDel
 * would create isolated vertices, those are deleted as well.
 *
 * ********************** Other Edge Operations **************************
 *
 * __gl_meshAddEdgeVertex( eOrg ) creates a new edge eNew such that
 * eNew == eOrg->Lnext, and eNew->Dst is a newly created vertex.
 * eOrg and eNew will have the same left face.
 *
 * __gl_meshSplitEdge( eOrg ) splits eOrg into two edges eOrg and eNew,
 * such that eNew == eOrg->Lnext.  The new vertex is eOrg->Dst == eNew->Org.
 * eOrg and eNew will have the same left face.
 *
 * __gl_meshConnect( eOrg, eDst ) creates a new edge from eOrg->Dst
 * to eDst->Org, and returns the corresponding half-edge eNew.
 * If eOrg->Lface == eDst->Lface, this splits one loop into two,
 * and the newly created loop is eNew->Lface.  Otherwise, two disjoint
 * loops are merged into one, and the loop eDst->Lface is destroyed.
 *
 * ************************ Other Operations *****************************
 *
 * __gl_meshNewMesh() creates a new mesh with no edges, no vertices,
 * and no loops (what we usually call a "face").
 *
 * __gl_meshUnion( mesh1, mesh2 ) forms the union of all structures in
 * both meshes, and returns the new mesh (the old meshes are destroyed).
 *
 * __gl_meshDeleteMesh( mesh ) will free all storage for any valid mesh.
 *
 * __gl_meshZapFace( fZap ) destroys a face and removes it from the
 * global face list.  All edges of fZap will have a NULL pointer as their
 * left face.  Any edges which also have a NULL pointer as their right face
 * are deleted entirely (along with any isolated vertices this produces).
 * An entire mesh can be deleted by zapping its faces, one at a time,
 * in any order.  Zapped faces cannot be used in further mesh operations!
 *
 * __gl_meshCheckMesh( mesh ) checks a mesh for self-consistency.

log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

       converts this so it looks like a record followed by a newline.	
       Unfortunately, the size reported by fstat() (and fseek/ftell)	
       counts the two bytes for the record terminator, while fread()	
       counts only one.  So, fread() sees fewer bytes in the file (size	
       minus # of records) and thus when asked to read the amount	
       returned by stat(), it fails.
       The best solution, suggested by DEC, seems to consider the length
       returned from fstat() as an upper bound and call fread() with
       a record length of 1. Then don't check the return value.
       We'll check for 0 for gross error that's all.

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

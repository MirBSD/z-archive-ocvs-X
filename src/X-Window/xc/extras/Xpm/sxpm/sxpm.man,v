.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fIsxpm\fP program can be used to view any XPM (version 1, 2, or 3) file
and/or to convert a file from XPM1 or XPM2 to XPM version 3. If \fIsxpm\fP is
run with any dummy option specified, the usage is displayed. If no geometry is
specified, the show window will have the size of the read pixmap. Pressing the
key Q in the window will quit the program.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.B \-d \fIdisplay\fP
Specifies the display to connect to.
.TP 8
.B \-g \fIgeom\fP
Window geometry (default is pixmap's size).
.TP 8
.B \-hints
Set ResizeInc for window.
.TP 8
.B \-icon \fIfilename\fP
Set icon to pixmap created from the file \fIfilename\fP.
.TP 8
.B \-plaid
Show the plaid pixmap which is stored as data\fP.
.TP 8
.B \fIfilename\fP
Read from the file \fIfilename\fP and from standard input if \fIfilename\fP is '-'.
If no input is specified sxpm reads from standard input.
.TP 8
.B \-o \fIfilename\fP
Write to the file \fIfilename\fP (overwrite if it already exists) and to
standard output if \fIfilename\fP is '-'.
.TP 8
.B \-mono
Use the colors specified for a monochrome visual.
.TP 8
.B \-grey4
Use the colors specified for a 4 color greyscale visual.
.TP 8
.B \-grey
Use the colors specified for a greyscale visual.

.B \-pcmap
Use a private colormap.
.TP 8
.B \-closecolors
Try to use "close colors" before reverting to other visuals.
.TP 8
.B \-nod
Do not display the pixmap in a window.  (Useful when using as converter)
.TP 8
.B \-nom
Do not use the clipmask if there is any.
.TP 8
.B \-sc \fIsymbol colorname\fP
Override default color to \fIsymbol\fP to \fIcolorname\fp.
.TP 8
.B \-sp \fIsymbol pixelvalue\fP
Override default color to \fIsymbol\fP to \fIpixelvalue\fp.
.TP 8
.B \-cp \fIcolorname pixelvalue\fP
Override default color to \fIcolorname\fP to \fIpixelvalue\fp.
.TP 8
.B \-rgb \fIfilename\fP
Search color names in the file \fIfilename\fP and write them out instead of
the rgb values.
.TP 8
.B \-v
Verbose - to print out extensions (stderr).


.SH KNOWN BUGS
Some window managers may not accept a pixmap which is not a bitmap as icon
because this does not respect ICCCM, many of the well known ones will accept
it though.

1.1.9.1

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Release 1.95.2 Fri Jul 27 2001
	- Nore changes to make MSVC happy with the build; add a single
	  workspace to support both the library and xmlwf applicatiion.
	- Added a Windows installer for Windows users; includes
	  xmlwf.exe.
	- Added compile-time constants that can be used to determine the
	  Expat version
	- Removed a lot of GNU-specific dependencies to aide portability
	  among the various Unix flavors.
	- Fix the UTF-8 BOM bug.
	- Cleaned up warning messages for several compilers.
	- Added the -Wall, -Wstrict-prototypes options for GCC.
Release 1.95.1 Sun Oct 22 15:11:36 EDT 2000
	- Changes to get expat to build under Microsoft compiler
	- Removed all aborts and instead return an UNEXPECTED_STATE error.
	- Fixed a bug where a stray '%' in an entity value would cause an
	  abort.
	- Defined XML_SetEndNamespaceDeclHandler. Thanks to Darryl Miles for
	  finding this oversight.
	- Changed default patterns in lib/Makefile.in to fit non-GNU makes
	  Thanks to robin@@unrated.net for reporting and providing an
	  account to test on.
	- The reference had the wrong label for XML_SetStartNamespaceDecl.
	  Reported by an anonymous user.
Release 1.95.0 Fri Sep 29 2000
	- XML_ParserCreate_MM
		Allows you to set a memory management suite to replace the
		standard malloc,realloc, and free.
	- XML_SetReturnNSTriplet
		If you turn this feature on when namespace processing is in
		effect, then qualified, prefixed element and attribute names
		are returned as "uri|name|prefix" where '|' is whatever
		separator character is used in namespace processing.
	- Merged in features from perl-expat
		o XML_SetElementDeclHandler
		o XML_SetAttlistDeclHandler
		o XML_SetXmlDeclHandler
		o XML_SetEntityDeclHandler
		o StartDoctypeDeclHandler takes 3 additional parameters:
			sysid, pubid, has_internal_subset
		o Many paired handler setters (like XML_SetElementHandler)
		  now have corresponding individual handler setters
		o XML_GetInputContext for getting the input context of
		  the current parse position.
	- Added reference material
	- Packaged into a distribution that builds a sharable library

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

Release 1.95.6 Tue Jan 28 2003
        - Added XML_FreeContentModel().
        - Added XML_MemMalloc(), XML_MemRealloc(), XML_MemFree().
        - Fixed a variety of bugs: see SF issues 615606, 616863,

          events that were already handled by another handler.
          Initial patch contributed by Darryl Miles.
        - Removed unnecessary DllMain() function that caused static
          linking into a DLL to be difficult.
        - Added VC++ projects for building static libraries.

          libexpat.dll; this fixes SF bug #432456.

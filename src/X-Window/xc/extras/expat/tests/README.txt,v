1.1
log
@Initial revision
@
text
@This directory contains the (fledgling) test suite for Expat.  The
tests provide general unit testing and regression coverage.  The tests
are not expected to be useful examples of Expat usage; see the
examples/ directory for that.

The Expat tests use the "Check" unit testing framework for C.  More
information on Check can be found at:

        http://check.sourceforge.net/

Check 0.8 must be installed before the unit tests can be compiled & run.

Since both Check and this test suite are young, it can all change in a
later version.

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

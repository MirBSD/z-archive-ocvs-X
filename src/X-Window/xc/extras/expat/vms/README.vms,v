		Added rudimentary build procedures for 
		OpenVMS based on work by Martin Vorlaender.


You'll need MMS or its freeware equivalent MMK.  Just go to the 
top-level directory and type

$ MMS/DESCRIPTION=[.vms]
 
  or

$ MMK/DESCRIPTION=[.vms]

You'll end up with the object library expat.olb.  For now, installation
consists merely of copying the object library, include files, and
documentation to a suitable location.  

To-do list:

	-- create a shareable image
	-- build and run the tests and build the xmlwf utility
	-- create an install target

@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

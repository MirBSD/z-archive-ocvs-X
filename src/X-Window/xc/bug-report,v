@[PLEASE make your Subject: line as descriptive as possible.
Subjects like "xterm bug" or "bug report" are not helpful!]
[Remove all the explanatory text in brackets before mailing.]
[Send to xbugs@@x.org, as shown in the sample message 
header below]

[NOTE: This form is intended for reporting bugs to X.Org about X.Org releases.
If you're reporting an XFree86-specific bug, please use the BugReport form
in xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/doc/ and send it to xfree86@@xfree86.org.]

To: xbugs@@x.org
Subject: [area]: [synopsis]   [replace with actual area and short description]

     VERSION:

R6.6

     CLIENT MACHINE and OPERATING SYSTEM:

[e.g. Sparc/SunOS 5.6, S.u.S.E. Linux 5.0 kernel 2.0.30, etc.]

     DISPLAY TYPE:

[e.g. Xsun, Xhp, Xdec, XF86_*, /usr/openwin/bin/Xsun, etc. ]

     WINDOW MANAGER:

[e.g. twm, mwm, fvwm95, enlightenment, etc.]

     COMPILER:

[e.g. native ANSI cc, native cc, ecgs 1.0, etc.]

     AREA:

[Area of the source tree affected,
e.g., Xserver, Xlib, Xt, Xaw, PEX, twm, xterm, xmh, config, ....
Please only one area per bug report.]

     SYNOPSIS:

[Brief description of the problem and where it is located]

     DESCRIPTION:

[Detailed description of problem.  Don't presume that the bug
is self evident. If possible cite specification references (X,
ANSI/POSIX/ISO, X/Open, etc.) to support why it is a bug. For
program crashes a little bit of analysis about why a NULL pointer
was dereferenced or why a buffer overflowed goes a long way.
If this is a request for an enhancement, justify it.]

     REPEAT BY:

[What you did to get the error; include test program or session
transcript if at all possible. Be specific -- if we can't reproduce 
it, we can't fix it.  Don't just say "run this program and it will 
be obvious," tell us exactly what we should see when the program 
is run. Bug reports without a clear, deterministic way of reproducing 
them will be fixed only after all bug reports that do.]

     SAMPLE FIX:

[Please send context diffs (`diff -c original-file fixed-file`).  
Be sure to include the "XConsortium" or "TOG" ident line in any 
diffs -- the best way to do this is to add your own versioning 
line immediately after ours.]

1.1.9.1
log
@OpenBSD just has imported exactly this tree into their vendor branch,
called the same tag, in XF4/xc
This is, apparently, the last XFree86 snapshot before the licence change
(ie, addition of the advertising clause)

Since the developers don't see any problems with that, and we would like
to integrate improvements done by the remaining one or two (or so) XFree86
developers (j/k), this prepares enabling us to update X-Window in the future.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 XF4 repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This finalizes starting an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

<h1>History of MirOS</h1>

<p>On <a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?m=103065556502499">August
 29th, 2002</a>, <a href="http://theos.com/">Theo de Raadt</a>, leader
 of the operating system project <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>,
 co-founder of its predecessor <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a>,
 dismissed the port of some NetBSD user-land utility to OpenBSD, made by
 a person already known, loved and hated in the community: Thorsten
 Glaser. After struggling around, he eventually decided to not only keep
 <tt>wtf(6)</tt> (which later became wtf(1)) in his local tree, but also
 to start a patch kit and upload it to his personal homepage webspace.</p>
<p>Quickly, the first binary release was made, after various other
 improvements found their way into the patchkit - among the first, some
 code of the then-dying MicroBSD (publically released under a good licence),
 and the KAME patch bringing IPv6 support to the Apache HTTP d&aelig;mon.
 <br />It was to be decided how to name the child. The first shot was
 <tt>OpenBSD-current-mirabile</tt>, since Thorsten Glasers pseudonym has
 been like it since early 1993; but that was too long. Even the later
 <tt>OpenBSD-mirabile</tt> was too long, and lasted not more than a few
 days until the next quarrel with the OpenBSD people. The patchkit was
 then renamed into BSD-mirabile.</p>
<p>Eventually, it was decided that using CVS instead of just providing
 diffs to OpenBSD would be progress (I've considered OpenCM more than
 just a little bit, but its main advocate and coder Todd Fries told me
 that I'd need 6-8 Gibibytes of RAM for what I've planned (not even
 including X-Window or GNU GCC 3.x), so I decided to stick with CVS
 until OpenCM would be ready for prime time). The patchkit was then
 renamed to MirBSD. (Update: Subversion isn't up for even GNU Mono with
 only like 50'000 files under version control, so even less for MirOS
 with like 120'000 files in CVS.)</p>
<p>Later, a project was born from the patchkit, and designing MirLinux
 was started (purely as a quick and weird idea, qua the absolute
 contrary of Debian GNU/NetBSD). When the first person, namely Benny
 Siegert (who had looked down on MirBSD before &quot;because it lacks
 NLS support&quot;), having submitted many uncommitted ports to OpenBSD
 in the past, joined and started to help with the MirBSD ports tree,
 the project was named <tt>The MirOS Project</tt>, and the former MirBSD
 ports tree, evolved from the OpenBSD ports tree, was separated from
 the MirOS base system and called <tt>MirPorts Framework</tt> when we
 heard that many people are using NetBSD pkgsrc (the same thing as the
 ports tree, called differently, on NetBSD) on their GNU/Linux boxen.</p>
<p>A real boost came into the project when Waldemar Brodkorb of LUUSA,
 netzladen.org and OpenBSD.de fame started a Quality Assurance whack
 on MirPorts, and simultaneously decided to donate a SPARCstation 20
 with a bit of prodding to Thorsten Glaser, in order to resurrect the
 port to the sparc32 architecture.</p>
<p>At the same time, MirOS has reached a pretty stable shape, and has
 been deemed commercial quality by more than one company. There are a
 lot of people around the world using MirOS, mostly as an alternative
 to OpenBSD (which lacks ISDN support, IPv6 Apache, and comes with
 code (Kerberos, AFS, YP, BIND) most users don't need).</p>

<h3>More information</h3>
<p>If you <em>really</em> want to read the full story, please go look
 after the <a href="/clogs/">ChangeLog files</a> (they are huge).
 History before that has been preserved back to MirBSD snap#2 in the
 <a href="/MirOS/">historic releases</a> folder; the source code
 consists of a current (at that time) OpenBSD checkout and the files
 called &quot;obsd.*&quot; (yes it really was a patch kit).<br />
 Unluckily, most of the personal-homepage CVS history from that time
 (I even did log entries describing the changes) is lost, as well as
 the first versions of the patch kit.</p>
<p>Not really from Day Zero (real men don't count from One :), but
 less than six weeks later, the <a href="/?older">web log</a> started.
 This does not contain every change in every little detail, and is
 emotionally written and heavily biased, even offending the OpenBSD
 developers (which I highly appreciate for their work). Read it at
 your own danger if you are really into it.</p>
<p>An <a href="/?bsd-intro">introduction to BSD</a> which has been
 written by Thorsten Glaser when he was still member of the
 Open.BSDcows.netproject. Nice reading, although it could need
 quite an update.<br />MirOS also appears in the <a
 href="http://www.levenez.com/unix/">Unix Family Tree</a>, although
 the arrows pointing to it aren't accurate at all (but if every single
 synchronization with the other BSD had been synched, you could not
 read the tree anyways).</p>

<h3>A short timeline submitted to Levenez</h3>
<p>Note: this has been amended with updates from the original mail.</p>

Subject: MirBSD at Unix history

Hi,

I'd like to give some official information regarding the history
of MirOS BSD.

It all started on 29. August 2002, combining OpenBSD (-current)
and NetBSD (-current) at that time.
Maybe you might want to add an asterisk to the arrow from OpenBSD,
adding a footnote which says that sync with OpenBSD is done almost
every few weeks, so the chart would be unreadible if you put them
all there.

Only a few days later, most of the MicroBSD material which this
"Jedi/Sector One" guy published was integrated into the tree.

Synchronization with OpenBSD happened all the time, and NetBSD
material was integrated pretty frequently as well.
Here are some of these I can quickly grep from the changelog:

11.10.2002	earliest point in history of which contributed
		material (web page entries) could be preserved
03.11.2002      ELF exec support, inspired from NetBSD, after the
                OpenBSD ELF patch didn't really work
		earliest point in history of which material could
		be <a href="/cvs.cgi/contrib/docs/historic/">preserved</a>
10.02.2003      finally, ELF with the gcc 3.x port
25.03.2003      ISDN4BSD from third-party diff to OpenBSD 2.7,
                later backed out
27.03.2003      src/lib/csu from NetBSD-current
05.04.2003      growfs/ffsinfo from FreeBSD-current (UFS2 backed out)
05.04.2003      CTM from FreeBSD-current
06.04.2003      ISDN4BSD from NetBSD-current
10.04.2003      evilwm from upstream
02.09.2003      PLIP from NetBSD-current (untested :(
09.11.2003      elf2aout from NetBSD-current with tweaks
                needed for sparc support
27.11.2003	code and idea exchange with ekkoBSD
10.12.2003	first build with propolice-gcc3 done
21.12.2003	first time working cd/msdos boot loader on broken hardware
27.12.2003	20C3 event, changing default uname(1) output
		from OpenBSD to MirBSD and start fixing stuff;
		setup of a MirOS #7-stable branch.
15.01.2004	Server problems solved; development plan changed
31.01.2004	Preparation of release-quality snapshot (i386 only)
		with gcc3, new CSU, WineX working; most improvements ever
03.05.2004	First release via <a href="http://f.scarywater.net/miros/">BitTorrent</a>
29.08.2004	Two-Year Birthday Snapshot (i386 only)
17.09.2004	System build with -fstack-protector-all
10.12.2004	Start of ncvs (CVS repository using GNU cvs 1.12)
04.01.2005	Import of the GNU Compiler Collection 3.4.4 (-stable)
22.01.2005	First working snapshot with gcc 3.4-stable etc., no X11.

Releases:

11.10.2002      #0 (first ever)
31.11.2002      #1 (diversion from OpenBSD; getting used to development)
28.01.2003      #2 (a.out with exec-ELF)
02.03.2003      #3 (ELF)
16.04.2003      #4 (first really stable; still used!)
11.06.2003      #5 (fixed executable format; most tested release ever)
08.07.2003      #6 (LinuxTag special edition)
28.09.2003      #7semel (intended to be a commercial-quality product)
04.10.2003      #7bis (must-update critical bug fix release)
22.11.2003      #7ter (same codebase as #7bis, i386/sparc available,
                openbsd errata fixed, many other small bugs too)
early 02.2004   #7-current snapshots (gcc 3.2.3 with Propolice)
13.03.2004	#7-current snapshots (XFree86 4.4, Ada, Pascal, ...)
May-June 2004	The great incompatibility - large parts of infrastructure
		rewritten; binary incompatibility introduced, time_t bumped
		to 64 bit; no SMP.
14.06.2004	#7quater (#7-stable for i386, sparc)
17.09.2004	Now, all functions are SSP protected.
28.12.2004	#7quinquies (#7-stable for i386), maybe ending #7 lifetime
early 2005	#8 (gcc 3.4 in-tree; i386/sparc (macppc?) BSD)
summer 2005?    #9 (featuring mirppc port)
end of 2006?	#10 (featuring MirLinux?)

@we decided it'd be better to not put ourselfes under strain and bring
out just another release right now.
instead, #7-stable will be continued, and it's pretty stable anyways.
for people wanting the new features, we'll throw out high quality
snapshots (though they are for being tested, too...)
we'll work on stuff without pressure from the outside, so to not getting
disturbed. we'll work without a deadline measured in days, either.

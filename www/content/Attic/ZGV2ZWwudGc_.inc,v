 href="http://mira.66h.42h.de/">home page</a> or the page <a

 I've currently no homepage, but got an <a
 href="http://www.advogato.org/person/8088/">Advogato</a> account
 which I use only casually - especially since the MirOS new-CMS
 offers an easier weblog facility. You can find out a little more in <a
 href="http://wiki.mirbsd.de/MirAbile">the MirWiki</a>.</p>
<p>These are things I'm doing on MirOS or planning to do (I'm also the
 guy that rewrites the boot loaders when he's bored...):</p><ul>
<li>Keep it clean. NLS free, few GNU, you get the idea.</li>
<li>Keep it updated. Synchronize code in tree with upstream code if
 possible, as well as with the other BSD projects (NetBSD, OpenBSD,
 ekkoBSD). Try to find and fix as many bugs as possible.</li>
<li>Get gcc 3.x including GNU Pascal working, but keep the base system
 compilable using only the fall-back compiler. (done)</li>
<li>Get WineX working.</li>
<li>Get HERCULES support and 3D graphics stuff into XFree86, and
 write a framebuffer for Hercules, then VESA.</li>
<li>Write netboot and FAT&reg;-compatible filesystem support for /boot.
 Make it (really) runnable as a native MS-DOS&reg; binary.</li>
<li>Write a BASIC compiler and switch the MirOS homepage to use it
	instead of PHP. (just kidding)</li>
<li>Write a depenguinator, which allows to remotely install MirOS
 over any GNU/Linux (and, maybe later, Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg;)
 system.</li>
<li>Port the Linux kernel to the MirOS userland and MirPorts.</li>
<li>Port MirOS to the Interix subkernel under the Microsoft&reg;
 NT kernel, including MirPorts.</li>
</ul><hr />
<p>Don't be shocked when you get what seems to be my attitude. I tend
 to advocate things I like pretty hard, and dislike &quot;newbies&quot;
 and in general everyone who just makes me work with nothing in return.
 I'm not used to &quot;social&quot; communication either, but respond
 in ironic, satiric or cynical ways fairly often.</p>
<p>Some details:<br />I live in Bonn, former capital of Germany,
 though I come from the Eifel region. I'm 22 years old and try to
 earn money (not really enough for a living) by being a trainee at
 Germany's largest telco/ISP, Deutsche Telekom AG. I'm also allowed
 to sell <em>MirBSD based comm/file servers</em> to earn a few
 &euro; more. Please drop me a note if you're interested.</p>
<p>For more information, feel free to come to the MirOS IRC channel
 <tt>#deutsch</tt> in <tt>irc6.oftc.net:6667</tt> and talk
 to <tt>&lt;mira&gt;</tt>. I can handle German, English, Latin
 and a few words of nederlands and espa&ntilde;ol. I'm an assembly
 and GW-BASIC coder by heart, but have learned Pascal, Shell, BSD make,
 C, PHP since, and can debug simple perl scripts although I'm unable
 to ever learn that language.</p>

@Mostly... not fully...

One weekend's worth of work.

- catch up website log with changes really done till today
- add catch-up entries for wbx@@ and bsiegert@@, too
- move GNU documentation to src/gnu/doc and simplify it
- re-run autoconf on the gnu part of the tree again, to
  catch up with the GFDL-documentation removal
- provide non-GFDL-licenced as(1) and ld(1) manual pages
  XXX these are more than outdated!
- bump MirOS patchlevel
- build the system through, fixing showstoppers where
  they are encountered
- index.cgi and index.php come before index.htm,
  default.htm and index.html in httpd.conf
- speed up PHP processing
- prepare for "new" OpenBSD pkgtools (unsupported by MirBSD,
  but some MirPorts people want to play with them)
- move old weblog to CMS; update my info again
- update hRef""s in old weblogs
- move release announcements to /historic/
- copy feature list from last release announcement
  XXX need a "readible short list", or even
  XXX	a separation for the target environment
  XXX	(e.g. suits / techies / clients)
- add some recent news, so the page ain't empty
  missing:
	- about
	  + MirOS
	  + MirPorts
	- get MirOS!	(http d/l, http install, install docs)
	- relations	(to other BSD)
	  + ??? events ??? (here?)
	- history
	- older releases	(historic)
	- help pages
	  + FAQ
	  + Docs/Tuts	(hi wbx@@ here comes your place)
	    + install docs
	  + mailing lists
	- developers
	  + wbx
	  + bsiegert
	  + cnuke
	- CVSweb	(XXX need BSDadvocacy.org fix before)
	- AnonCVS	(howto; link to)
	- Links
  alternatively, change the layout? suggestions?
  why am I the only one who cares about www?
- merge development plan
- put a "project" into the miros page head
- fix cdboot Makefile
- fix gas wanting us a.out again (wut?)
  (turned out to be a must-fix in configure.in)
- stand/cdboot/NOTES merged into stand/README
- sync distrib set lists
- have TORI device (i386 libsa) always use bounce buffers
  (which, in fact, makes it succeed in loading the kernel)
  XXX kernel says it has less than 4 meg ram (degraded mode)
  XXX may be a bochs issue?
- fix random.S again
- move determining of file name / raw file flag in both
  bios/toridev.c to the end of bios/toriopen()
  => enables us to have two drivers at once
- fix disk probing for CD devices wrt BIOS driver

(eww. The tree isn't fully broken, but neither boot
 nor cdboot.bin are usable at all at the moment.
 I'll fix that ASAP.)

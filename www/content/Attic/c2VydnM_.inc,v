<h1>Services and Mirrors</h1>

<h3>Website mirrors</h3>

<p>The main website mirror of The MirOS project is located <a
 href="https://mirbsd.bsdadvocacy.org:8890/">at
 https://MirBSD.BSDadvocacy.org:8890/</a> (also <a
 href="http://mirbsd.bsdadvocacy.org/">http://MirBSD.BSDadvocacy.org/</a>
 if you prefer not to use SSL) and updated daily from CVS. This site is
 located in the united states of america, and not under control by the MirOS
 Project itself. There are other mirrors in other countries, which all are
 stuffed from a hidden master server in germany, which is under control by
 two MirOS developers, but not physically secured. The CVS master is located
 at the home of tg@@ and pretty secured.<br />
 <b>Current Mirrors:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://mirbsd.etherkiller.de">mirbsd.etherkiller.de</a> (DE)</li>
<li><a href="http://mirbsd.agentdero.com">mirbsd.agentdero.com</a> (US)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mailing Lists</h3>

<p>We've got a <a href="mailto:miros-discuss@@66h.42h.de">discussion
 mailing list</a> and a CVS changes mailing list, both of which are
 public. All subscribers of the CVS changes mailing list automatically
 are on the discussion mailing list as well. In order to subscribe, send
 a mail to <a href="mailto:postmaster@@66h.42h.de">the postmaster</a>.
 We've also got an internal developers-only list, although our development
 process is usually done in IRC entirely.</p>

<p>The <tt>miros-discuss@@</tt> list is published bidirectionally as
 <tt>gmane.os.miros.general</tt>, and <tt>miros-changes@@</tt> can be read
 via <tt>gmane.os.miros.cvs</tt> now, see <a href="http://gmane.org/">their
 website</a> for further information.</p>

<h3>Service mirrors</h3>

<p>We are offering the following services: the MirOS website, a download area
 containing releases of MirOS, the "current", the anonCVS and
 CVSweb services providing access to the MirOS CVS repository, and the
 anonRSYNC access to both CVS and download area.</p>

<p>Currently, a colocated developer server is synched from the master server;
 all mirrors get their content from it (or, rarely, other mirrors). In
 emergency cases, public services might get set up on that box, although we
 will have to pay a lot for traffic. At least BSDadvocacy and gwdg.de will
 provide downloads; at least BSDadvocacy will provide website services.
 As for anonCVS, CVSweb and especially anonRSYNC, we don't have an idea
 yet. Mainly, we "could" set it up on the dedicated box if we don't have
 to pay too much for the traffic.</p>

<p>The current situation is: BSDadvocacy gets its content from the hidden
 developer master server located behind a slow ADSL line. We got offers
 from two people to mirror at least the download area, but since anonrsync
 is not correctly working yet due to server and
 configuration issues to be resolved soon, we cannot offer them data
 sources to sync from.</p>

<p>The situation planned is: a colocated developer server is synched from
 the master server; all mirrors get their content from it. In emergency

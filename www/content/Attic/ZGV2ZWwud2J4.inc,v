@AAAAAAAAARGH base64 isn't sort-preserving :(

We've got a new developer, a new hope and a page about some
lazy person who reads this and should start porting ctorrent ;)

Welcome to the team.

@wbx@@ just told me in a personal talk that he would like to leave
the project for mostly personal reasons. It's sad but we accept
his request and will continue this work outselfes. We'd like to
express a "thank you" for what he has done, and wish good luck
for his university and further BSD work.

<p>
My name is Waldemar Brodkorb. I was the third MirBSD developer, and I
mostly work on non-x86 stuff and ports.
</p>

<p>Some long-term goals I would like MirOS to achieve are:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Support for the <tt>sparc64 and alpha</tt> architecture.</li>
 <li>Verified Exec from NetBSD / Stephanie patchset for OpenBSD</li>
 <li>more ipv6 enabled ports, openldap 2.1.x, amavisd-new, squirrelmail</li>
 <li>Support for native Java 1.4.x (NetBSD)</li>
 <li>Support for a good MirBSD crossenvironment like in NetBSD</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can find more about me and my computer hobby at my
<a href="http://www.thinknow.de">personal homepage</a>.

<h1>Errata Corrigendaque</h1>
<p>Users of MirOS #7bis please note that the #7ter release is built upon
 the same codebase, but with sparc support added, and a few minor flaws
 fixed. Therefore there is no reason to not update to MirOS #7ter.
 For increased security, please consider updating to MirOS #7quater,
 although you will have to adjust for the new package tools, which in
 turn are necessary for installing from current MirPorts, which is
 strongly advised due to security issues in third-party applications
 anyways.</p>
<p>Users of MirOS #7semel have been advised to update to #7bis a long
 time ago. The #7 release had numerous flaws which have been corrected
 as soon as possible at that time.</p>
<p>Users of MirOS #6 (Linuxtag Edition) and even older versions are
 recommended to consider re-installing from a recent -current snapshot.</p>
<p>Users of MirOS #4, please note that the egcc port, which was necessary,
 has been removed in favour of an in-tree gcc 3.2.3 compiler. Please remove
 the egcc compiler except libestdc++ before updating.</p>
<p>Users of MirOS #2, please note that the executable format has changed,
 and only static executables which do not load modules (for example, not
 Apache) are still able to run under a more recent release of MirOS.</p>
<p>Users of even older BSD-mirabile or OpenBSD-current-mirabile releases:
 I'd like to hear from you ;-)<br />If anyone is still productively using
 MirOS #0 to #4, please drop me a note and tell me how you already liked
 the product. You will be even more pleased with the more recent versions.</p>
<h3>Caveats</h3>
<p>MirOS -current (to become release #8) has switched to using gcc 3.2.3
 with Propolice as system compiler, and dropped support for non-Pentium
 CPUs (on x86) again. You are advised to read the <a href="/clogs/">change
 logs</a> if you are interested in all details prior to installing. Until
 MirOS #8 is formally released, there will not be a new features page.</p>

@my bare attempt at an errata page for
 - current users (almost complete, but covers only May 2004 and up)
 - version 7 users (for starters)
 - users of older releases (update hints, and feedback request)

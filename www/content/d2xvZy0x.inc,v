@mass update: RCS IDs moved into visible body (so user can see whether
the page has been updated since the last try)
also update News a bit and denote anonCVS as broken again (until it's
fixed on bsdadvocacy or we get a dedicated...)

<h1>MirBSD grows too fast</h1>
<p>This is an archived weblog of the development leading to <a
 href="/?main">MirOS</a>. All entries are courtesy of tg@@ and historic.</p>
<h3>News <small><a href="#eof">bottom</a></small></h3>
<p>03.12.2002<br />In order to test my snapshot, I did a complete re-install,
 and I had to do a re-partitioning anyways. Unluckily I hosed the backup
 process, and lost the cvs repository (but not the checked out copy). Busy.</p>
<p>04.12.2002<br />I just discovered that there has been a fix for misc/mc
 with regard to the terminal Fn-Key issue. It got lost, somewhen. Plus, this
 propolice stuff is gonna suck. Downloading CTM...</p>
<p>04.12.2002<br />Done RCSId with a simple regexp search-replace; prepared
 re-upload of jupp/DOS16. Regenerated patches in sync; now trying to go and
 build libc, gcc and egcc propolice-enabled.</p>
<p>20.12.2002<br />Try to fix ports - especially egcs. Need yet to test it.
 Add a port of Lutz Donnerhacke's pgp-2.6.3in version. Start synching with
 latest -current (still unusable). Update ports INDEX.</p>
<p>30.12.2002<br />Sync, make sure it compiles (after cvs ci, maybe I've
 got to come back). Maybe fix md/mi lists. Need a Lynx-current port.</p>
<p>31.12.2002<br />This one compiled fine, plus some minimal changes.</p>
<p>05.01.2003<br />Major sync, byebye amiga. Add gcc-3.2.1 propolice diff
 backport from cvs. Change to /etc/profile (alias hd).</p>
<p>06.01.2003<br />Still no lynx-current port, still not tested, but sync
 because xsa-the-bsdcow wants to examine my stuff. make INDEX tho.</p>
<p>10.01.2003<br />No lynx, but make INDEX after adding just another egcs
 (gcc) port - this time with <b>latest</b> propolice from etoh@@... (still
 not tested; not even all diffs synched)</p>
<p>... later the same night<br />That stuff (with the
 [http://templeofhate.com/tglaser/obsd/gcc-3.2.1p1-system.tgz] new
 C compiler) survived a make build release, so I got a chance to
 sync the lists and commit an updated set of diffs. I don't know if my
 bktr diff is correct, though.</p>
<p>... after a reboot<br />I just noticed I had a dupe in the diff file
 packaging lists. This must not happen. Never.<br />
 I also have some too much files in them, files with empty diffs. Why?
 Maybe some stuff was committed. Help me to spot them.<br />
 Fix the problem in obsd.tygs, make a new kernel *sigh*</p>
<p>16.01.2003<br />Sync, prepare for libpthread changes.<br />Also
 convert most of the ports to force-flavour style instead... should fix
 some dependencies.</p>
<p>17.01.2003<br />make build release, sync, commit, build new egcc.<br />
 That's how it was planned; however I had to make contbuild quite often,
 so I didn't make release. Do that tomorrow or so.<br />
 The system should then be ready to make a snapshot, but I'll <b>delay</b>
 that until I got the ELF patches (so I can easily go back myself too :)</p>
<p>18.01.2003<br />Major updates:</p><ul>
 <li>I decided to split the snXXXX.php files after each successful snapshot
  release, in order to ease showing you what changed since the last one.</li>
 <li>Fixed small bugs in regen-obsdp.sh</li>
 <li>Got a fix to jdk-1.3-linux by Santana</li>
 <li>Todd Fries joined us in IRC and I helped him finish a patch to the
  kernel facilitating "ps a" and "ps e" limits. He started looking over
  my diffs, finding much of them interesting, wondering why they have
  not been integrated into the main trunk.<br /> He started waking
  interest in me to use OpenCM. I'll wait until it's stable tho.</li>
 <li>I just started using ssh-agent. Had to type in the ssh key password
  waaay too often, since I manage(d) <a href="http://open.bsdcow.net/">the
  OpenBSDcow Network</a>, this page and <a href="http://www.trash.net/">a
  trash.net shell account</a>.</li>
 <li>GCC 3.2 is stable, but don't try G++ or even the Jehova&trade; compiler.</li>
 <li>as usual - sync, ports/make index</li></ul><p>
 I hope to be able to make a snapshot RSN - waiting for the ELF diffs. Todd
 Fries offered me an ELF snapshot, but I think I could only use gcc+binutils
 out of it when I really get the diffs. Hm, still no lynx port, lazy me.</p>
<p>19.01.2003<br />Hmm. I could not sleep more than 6.5 hours. Weird. So I
 decided to finally make that damn lynx-current port. Here it is.<br />
 It needs a patch to the terminfo master file though.</p>
<p>19.01.2003 later the evening<br />CVS fucked up basically any $OpenBSD
 RCS Id it could find. Reverting them to content-less state.</p>
<p>21.01.2003<br />I must be crazy and/or have too muchtime on my hands.
 But maybe it's just too few, because on the evenings there is only three
 and a half one from coming home to going into bed. Well, sync, since bind
 was imported I cobbled a new host(1) together, etc.pp - and I've synched
 the diff packaging lists. Hm. Yesterday... oh yes, I set up a freenet-project
 persistent node. I should do a port for that, too.<br />Oh well, crazy me
 adds contributed stuff from the web page, too...</p>
<p>24.01.2003<br />Synched and added some new acronymes. Update fast, there
 are quite some fixes in it.</p>
<p>25.01.2003<br />Sync, fix, make build, bump mc, try to switch c++ compiler
 to egcs-3.2 (but do not commit changes yet). make release done tomorrow.</p>
<p>26.01.2003<br />Despite the nice weather, I fixed some gcc compiler warnings
 about e.g. uninitialized variables, and did a make release, synched everything.
 Now I've got spare time to go outside. Well, C++ is still flakey, but OTOH I
 don't know C++ and leave it to someone else to fix it.</p>
<p>26.01.2003<br />Put obsd.gcc and obsd.mini -&gt; obsd.misc</p>
<p>27.01.2003<br />Some stylistic fixes of the web page. Update lynx port;
 make gcc port breakage in libestdc++ ltconfig take fewer time. Move utilities
 from game to base. Check in a SNAPSHOT release candidate.<br />
 Last-Minute changes include diff-packaging-list fixes, movement of host and
 nslookup to usr.bin, correction of the nslookup manual page (8, not 1) and
 the according changes in the dist set lists.</p>
<p>Last-Minute Fixes to Snap#2 RC3<br />The sets were incorrect. D'oh.<br />
 I just saw that my termtypes diff got committed (not yet in). 10x miod</p>
<p><big>28.01.2003</big><br />The snapshot RC3 I built was a success. Expect
 it, affiliated diffs, my-ports.tgz and basic packages, as well as a PGP
 signed RIPEMD-160 hash file, to make its way to the mirrors soon.</p>

1.1
log
@Mostly... not fully...

One weekend's worth of work.

- catch up website log with changes really done till today
- add catch-up entries for wbx@@ and bsiegert@@, too
- move GNU documentation to src/gnu/doc and simplify it
- re-run autoconf on the gnu part of the tree again, to
  catch up with the GFDL-documentation removal
- provide non-GFDL-licenced as(1) and ld(1) manual pages
  XXX these are more than outdated!
- bump MirOS patchlevel
- build the system through, fixing showstoppers where
  they are encountered
- index.cgi and index.php come before index.htm,
  default.htm and index.html in httpd.conf
- speed up PHP processing
- prepare for "new" OpenBSD pkgtools (unsupported by MirBSD,
  but some MirPorts people want to play with them)
- move old weblog to CMS; update my info again
- update hRef""s in old weblogs
- move release announcements to /historic/
- copy feature list from last release announcement
  XXX need a "readible short list", or even
  XXX	a separation for the target environment
  XXX	(e.g. suits / techies / clients)
- add some recent news, so the page ain't empty
  missing:
	- about
	  + MirOS
	  + MirPorts
	- get MirOS!	(http d/l, http install, install docs)
	- relations	(to other BSD)
	  + ??? events ??? (here?)
	- history
	- older releases	(historic)
	- help pages
	  + FAQ
	  + Docs/Tuts	(hi wbx@@ here comes your place)
	    + install docs
	  + mailing lists
	- developers
	  + wbx
	  + bsiegert
	  + cnuke
	- CVSweb	(XXX need BSDadvocacy.org fix before)
	- AnonCVS	(howto; link to)
	- Links
  alternatively, change the layout? suggestions?
  why am I the only one who cares about www?
- merge development plan
- put a "project" into the miros page head
- fix cdboot Makefile
- fix gas wanting us a.out again (wut?)
  (turned out to be a must-fix in configure.in)
- stand/cdboot/NOTES merged into stand/README
- sync distrib set lists
- have TORI device (i386 libsa) always use bounce buffers
  (which, in fact, makes it succeed in loading the kernel)
  XXX kernel says it has less than 4 meg ram (degraded mode)
  XXX may be a bochs issue?
- fix random.S again
- move determining of file name / raw file flag in both
  bios/toridev.c to the end of bios/toriopen()
  => enables us to have two drivers at once
- fix disk probing for CD devices wrt BIOS driver

(eww. The tree isn't fully broken, but neither boot
 nor cdboot.bin are usable at all at the moment.
 I'll fix that ASAP.)

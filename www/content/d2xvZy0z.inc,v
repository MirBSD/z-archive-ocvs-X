@mass update: RCS IDs moved into visible body (so user can see whether
the page has been updated since the last try)
also update News a bit and denote anonCVS as broken again (until it's
fixed on bsdadvocacy or we get a dedicated...)

<h1>MirBSD - Next to Perfection</h1>
<p>This is an archived weblog of the development leading to <a
 href="/?main">MirOS</a>. All entries are courtesy of tg@@ and historic.</p>
<h3>News <small><a href="#eof">bottom</a></small></h3>
<p>01.03.2003<br />Preparing MirBSD snap#3 build and release.</p>
<p>02.03.2003<br />The version of <tt>obsd.tygs</tt> provided with the
 snapshot is a newer one than that which was used to compile the snapshot.
 They only differ in XF4 files; you will need the newer diffs to successfully
 build XF4. The diffs were added after building the non-X tarballs, but while
 (before) compiling X and making the X tarballs. Don't worry.</p>
<p><b>02.03.2003</b><br /><big>Official release</big> of MirBSD Snap#3, built
 upon RC-3 sources. The file <tt>obsd.tygs</tt> has been revamped after the
 tarballs were packaged. The RMD160 checksum file is digitally signed.</p>
<p>04.03.2003<br />Due to lack of time I do not re-release Snap#3b, so please
 patch the sendmail <strong>remote root security hole</strong> yourself.<br />
 Added net/centericq bump by Han Boetes; sync.</p>
<p>07.03.2003<br />After coming back from work, I updated tinyirc from the
 original pre1.0 source, fixed stuff and implemented the <tt>/QUOTE</tt>
 command. Also, I updated GCC 3.2 to the latest propolice 2003-02-28 from
 etoh@@ and back-ported the in-tree diff to Lynx 2.8.2 to fall back to active
 ftp if passive fails to my nlynx port. Then I did a casual sync again.</p>
<p>19.03.2003<br />Lack of time. Independent of that, freenet-project is
 obsolete, and open.bsdcow will eventually be. And I decided to run MirBSD
 on a cvs by my own. Snap#4 will be released prior to that, though. Based
 upon 3.3-current.</p>
<p>20.03.2003<br />Finally disassociate with the Freenet-Project and the
 OpenBSDcow Project. Plan to go support IBM, do my own cvs. Eat something.</p>
<p>22.03.2003<br />jupp(1) needs auditing. I lost some diffs, and my local
 checked-out repo copy got damaged. Well, I recovered most of it, and now it's
 time to give its own CVS repo to MirBSD. This means, however, that MirBSD#4
 will take longer than planned. OTOH, it could mean that several new features
 and code will be integrated. And you finally get rid of Kerberos.<br />
 Creation of the repository has been succeeded so far, but it will take some
 time to merge the remaining parts of the <tt>obsd.*</tt> diff files. They
 will vanish from the web page thereafter.</p>
<p>23.03.2003<br />Merge XF4 and ports from MirBSD-old to MirBSD-new. Fix
 centericq. Plan to update gcc-propolice. Merge the remaining stuff from
 MirBSD-old and remove obsd.* diff files. Plan new web page.</p>
<p>24.03.2003<br />Sync gcc and propolice; try if FORTRAN, Objective C and
 Java&trade; compilers do at least build.</p>
<p>25.03.2003<br />Prepare for a sync to OpenBSD-current. Import basic ISDN
 support (not working yet). I need a sample <tt>isdnd rc</tt> file for ISP
 PPP access (T-Online probably). <tt>jupp</tt> also got improved. And no,
 the <tt>src/</tt> tree does <b>not</b> build yet.</p>
<p>26.03.2003<br />OpenBSD 3.3 is out, and <em>kawaii</em>, but I'm not in
 the mood to sync MirBSD yet, or do anything with it at all. Probably I'll
 sync first, then try to compile stuff. But the release is nowhere far.
 Maybe I even get crt*.o fixed before. (Can't I just use the NetBSD csu?)</p>
<p>27.03.2003<br />Whoops! ld.so did not appear in our repository; fixed that
 temporarily by &quot;cvs add&quot; until the import of 3.3-current. ISDNd
 compiles; ppp(8) compiles with ISDN and ATM as well, and make includes does
 succeed. And I forgot to announce the <a href="/?mail">mailing lists</a>.</p>
<p>29.03.2003<br />Just fixed the crtbegin/end/ld.so bug that prevented WineX
 from correctly working. That's why I now qualify myself as Journeyer on
 Advogato. Started porting WineX (again). It segfaults; many of my ./configure
 scripts don't work as regular user any more. Hmm. At least the base is unbroken
 for now, and compiles. I get weird messages from /bsd though.</p>
<p>30.03.2003<br />Worthwile to notice that gcc builds fully (except for Ada,
 which needs gnat installed in order to build gnat. Sounds familiar, eh?).</p>
<p>31.03.2003<br />The tree builds again, makes release just fine, etc.
 Several bugs have been fixed as well. Expect a snapshot to be released RSN.</p>
<p>03.04.2003<br />Start working at GNAT (GNU Ada to gcc translator), pfctl-de
 (German pfctl clone) and the "good/evil" bit in the IPv4 header. Follow OpenBSD
 source-changes and set a deadline for re-importing the tree.</p>
<p>05.04.2003<br />Imported <tt>ffsinfo(8)</tt>, <tt>growfs(8)</tt> and the
 current CTM version from FreeBSD, made them compile and did quick tests. No
 warranty etc., but they should work; I'll be using them myself now.<br />
 A sync to OpenBSD is planned, but I'm still waiting for a certain bug to be
 fixed. People are invited to send me diffs, ports, etc. as well.</p>
<p>06.04.2003<br />Okay, ISDN support is now complete. I removed the old one
 and started using the NetBSD tree (which also removes the <em>need</em> to
 send a postcard to Hellmuth Michaelis - I will do so even if I need it not,
 and urge MirBSD users to do the same). Thousand thanks to Ted U and Miod
 Vallat for helping and hinting. I successfully built and booted an ISDN
 enabled kernel and compiled <tt>isdnd</tt>; I have no way to test it at
 the moment though.<br />I can't really catch up with this blog, if you really
 want the latest news, either read the ChangeLogs, or subscribe (by sending
 an email to me) to MirBSD source-changes and/or ports-changes.</p>
<p>08.04.2003<br />So be it then. The next release will have neither gnat
 (working for OpenBSD to become ELF, so Marc Espie can make the bootstrapping :)
 nor WineX working. Someone can shed some light on the latter?<br />
 Now goes the ISDN test phase.</p>
<p>10.04.2003<br />Sync to OpenBSD-current, but only the cvs part of it,
 because it took too long, and I've got to work tomorrow.</p>
<p>11.04.2003<br />Switched to US keyboard layout and published my
 <tt>/etc/X11/xinit/.Xmodmap</tt> (<tt>/usr/share/misc/contrib/</tt>).</p>
<p>12.04.2003<br />Make the current kernel, ISDN and ATM enabled, boot;
 start verifying base (but not X-Window).</p>
<p>13.04.2003<br />Start importing XF4 again, in order to w&uuml;rg around
 the CVS import "bugs". Same will be done with ports and src; after that,
 MirBSD#4 will probably be released. I can't find people willing to test
 the new RAMDISKs (pppd, mount_nfs, ppp/pppoe, isdnd).</p>
<p>14.04.2003<br />Okay, the same import stuff goes for the ports tree.
 I decided to wait with source because a new less(1) got imported, with
 which you can scroll sidewards as well.<br />
 Plans for post-release:<br /> ISDN, boot floppies, tcc (from Fabrice
 Bellard), in-tree lynx to -current, rewind, wineX, gnat<br />
Suggest any more or help out!</p>

1.1
log
@Mostly... not fully...

One weekend's worth of work.

- catch up website log with changes really done till today
- add catch-up entries for wbx@@ and bsiegert@@, too
- move GNU documentation to src/gnu/doc and simplify it
- re-run autoconf on the gnu part of the tree again, to
  catch up with the GFDL-documentation removal
- provide non-GFDL-licenced as(1) and ld(1) manual pages
  XXX these are more than outdated!
- bump MirOS patchlevel
- build the system through, fixing showstoppers where
  they are encountered
- index.cgi and index.php come before index.htm,
  default.htm and index.html in httpd.conf
- speed up PHP processing
- prepare for "new" OpenBSD pkgtools (unsupported by MirBSD,
  but some MirPorts people want to play with them)
- move old weblog to CMS; update my info again
- update hRef""s in old weblogs
- move release announcements to /historic/
- copy feature list from last release announcement
  XXX need a "readible short list", or even
  XXX	a separation for the target environment
  XXX	(e.g. suits / techies / clients)
- add some recent news, so the page ain't empty
  missing:
	- about
	  + MirOS
	  + MirPorts
	- get MirOS!	(http d/l, http install, install docs)
	- relations	(to other BSD)
	  + ??? events ??? (here?)
	- history
	- older releases	(historic)
	- help pages
	  + FAQ
	  + Docs/Tuts	(hi wbx@@ here comes your place)
	    + install docs
	  + mailing lists
	- developers
	  + wbx
	  + bsiegert
	  + cnuke
	- CVSweb	(XXX need BSDadvocacy.org fix before)
	- AnonCVS	(howto; link to)
	- Links
  alternatively, change the layout? suggestions?
  why am I the only one who cares about www?
- merge development plan
- put a "project" into the miros page head
- fix cdboot Makefile
- fix gas wanting us a.out again (wut?)
  (turned out to be a must-fix in configure.in)
- stand/cdboot/NOTES merged into stand/README
- sync distrib set lists
- have TORI device (i386 libsa) always use bounce buffers
  (which, in fact, makes it succeed in loading the kernel)
  XXX kernel says it has less than 4 meg ram (degraded mode)
  XXX may be a bochs issue?
- fix random.S again
- move determining of file name / raw file flag in both
  bios/toridev.c to the end of bios/toriopen()
  => enables us to have two drivers at once
- fix disk probing for CD devices wrt BIOS driver

(eww. The tree isn't fully broken, but neither boot
 nor cdboot.bin are usable at all at the moment.
 I'll fix that ASAP.)

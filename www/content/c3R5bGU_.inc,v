<h1>Stylesheet Selector</h1>
<p>The MirOS project website has a number of CSS style sheets to
 offer in order to improve usability and readability on web browsers
 other than <a href="http://lynx.isc.org/">Lynx</a>, our preferred
 web browser. Please choose one of the following style sheets;
 this selection needs cookies enabled in order to work.</p>
<form method="get" action="/setcss.php"><p>
 <input type="radio" name="sheet" value="XXXX" /> Default<br />
 <input type="radio" name="sheet" value="konq" /> Old (better in Konqueror, worse in Bloatzilla)<br />
 <input type="radio" name="sheet" value="root" /> Admin (shows additional info)<br />
 <input type="radio" name="sheet" value="bare" /> bare (no colours)<br />
 <input type="radio" name="sheet" value="mini" /> mini (no fonts either)<br />
 <br /><input type="submit" value="OK" />
</p></form>

@* actually, MirPorts does support OpenBSD 3.4, and not just their
  last formal release (3.5 - support should be in, tho we're still
  at 3.4-current... give us another two weeks or so)
* revive and modernize the old style sheet with the floating box
  containing the validator and mail links
  -> it's MUCH better in konqueror
  -> it's MUCH better on pages smaller than the screen size
  no, it's not default, although I was tempted to...

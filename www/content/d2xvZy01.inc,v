<h1>MirBSD - You wish you had it. Eh?</h1>
<p>This is an archived weblog of the development leading to <a
 href="/?main">MirOS</a>. All entries are courtesy of tg@@ and historic.</p>
<h3>News <small><a href="#eof">bottom</a></small></h3>
<p><strong><tt>MirBSD #5 (interim)</tt> - Peaceful Coexistence</strong><br />
 Our latest and greatest release ever has been released. Despite being an
 interim release without working GNU gcc 3.3, it has been undergone the most
 pervasive pre-release tests a MirBSD snapshot or release has ever had. You
 may want to read the [a href="/historic/ann-5.htm"](archived) Release Announcement, where you
 find download links and other useful information, as well as the advertising
 clauses.</p>
<p>11.06.2003<br />Due to some unknown reason, stripped kernels with DDB
 compiled in just segfault. Until this is fixed, just strip all but one
 symbol out of the kernels, and MFC it to MirBSD#5 STABLE. Re-upload new
 <tt>cdrom33.fs</tt> and <tt>cd33.iso</tt> files.</p>
<p>13.06.2003<br />Update the <strong>djbdns</strong> port. Don't splitter
 it into three ports, use flavours and a bit of shell magic, as well as a
 huge bit of make magic. Update the <a href="http://www.fefe.de/dns/">IPv6
 patches</a> to latest niveau (test19) and integrate the IXFR diff found
 at Felix' site, too. Update WineX (doesn't work, still segfaults) and fix
 a man page - <tt>man(7)</tt>.</p>
<p>20.06.2003 catchup<br />Fix <tt>ksh(1)</tt> man page (kludge). Fix
 <tt>https</tt> support in lynx (ports/www/lynx), submit upstream. Renice
 X (contrib) and /etc/profile configurations; re-word licence template.
 Sync with OpenBSD-current for several important bug fixes. Add option for
 sendmail SASL to /etc/mk.conf. Import brk syscall fixes for the Linuxulator,
 from the OpenBSD mailing list (it's said to fix subjdk 1.3). Play with wine
 (doesn't work, still). Fix apache httpd behaviour to match DJB publicfile
 when referring to directories as files. Sync slave repo @@BSDadvocacy.</p>
<p>22.06.2003<br />Boot loader fixes.</p>
<p>28.06.2003<br />Update acronymes database; fix ksh (emacs-usemeta, tab
 completion [] escape); add irq2 target to ISA devices; <tt>portupgrade</tt>
 target to the top-level ports tree Makefile. Get some diffs from tedu@@ and
 protect just another file against multiple includes. niklas@@ supplied help
 for the ELF ld.so, I optimized manual pages again. Install more sample files
 for sendmail, to help the clueless. Prepare synching with OpenBSD in
 preparation of two big events.</p>
<p>30.06.2003<br />Do heavy amount of synching, building, testing, improving,
 fixing etc. - no huge functional differences though. Remove the A,B,C
 floppies in favour of the M,CD ones. Include ports tree users by default
 in <tt>master.passwd</tt>. Move portmap to /sbin, statically linked.
 Improve performance on newly created filesystems (disklabel, newfs) by
 increasing fragment size, block size and number of cylinders per group
 by 100%. Enable support for 80486DX and 80487SX chips. Rewrite root.mail
 and some man pages and scripts, as well as our fake NLS implementation.
 Regenerate generated files (ports tree, too). Remove amd (automount
 d&aelig;mon). Bump libc/libpthread minor. Several minor improvements.
 Add another hard link to hexdump/od, called <tt>hd</tt>, behaving like
 invoking <tt>hexdump</tt> with the new <tt>-H</tt> flag. Remove more
 LIBC_SCCS, protoize/unprotoize and gcov (since gcc 3.x comes with them
 as well). <a href="/MirOS/current/">Upload
 a snapshot.</a></p>
<p>05.07.2003 - Catch-Up<br />More sync, internal minor changes. Make
 the floppyM build. Re-wrap licence.template for more law-safety in
 Germany. Add acronyme expansion for SAP. Install SSL certificates from
 X509 Root CAs by default, for lynx. Enter MirBSD #6 (LinuxTag special
 edition) prerelease ("n").</p>
<p>06.07.2003<br />Exchange the <tt>src/lib/csu/</tt> system with that
 from NetBSD, yielding <tt>crti.o</tt> and <tt>crtn.o</tt>; adjust pgcc
 accordingly. Full sync against OpenBSD. Plan and/or do updates for:
 sirc, evilwm, lynx (in-tree). Use diff -du[p] where needed.</p>
<p>08.07.2003<br />Release the <b>LinuxTag Special Edition</b> #6, and
 skip over to the next file for development:</p>

@mass update: RCS IDs moved into visible body (so user can see whether
the page has been updated since the last try)
also update News a bit and denote anonCVS as broken again (until it's
fixed on bsdadvocacy or we get a dedicated...)

1.1
log
@Mostly... not fully...

One weekend's worth of work.

- catch up website log with changes really done till today
- add catch-up entries for wbx@@ and bsiegert@@, too
- move GNU documentation to src/gnu/doc and simplify it
- re-run autoconf on the gnu part of the tree again, to
  catch up with the GFDL-documentation removal
- provide non-GFDL-licenced as(1) and ld(1) manual pages
  XXX these are more than outdated!
- bump MirOS patchlevel
- build the system through, fixing showstoppers where
  they are encountered
- index.cgi and index.php come before index.htm,
  default.htm and index.html in httpd.conf
- speed up PHP processing
- prepare for "new" OpenBSD pkgtools (unsupported by MirBSD,
  but some MirPorts people want to play with them)
- move old weblog to CMS; update my info again
- update hRef""s in old weblogs
- move release announcements to /historic/
- copy feature list from last release announcement
  XXX need a "readible short list", or even
  XXX	a separation for the target environment
  XXX	(e.g. suits / techies / clients)
- add some recent news, so the page ain't empty
  missing:
	- about
	  + MirOS
	  + MirPorts
	- get MirOS!	(http d/l, http install, install docs)
	- relations	(to other BSD)
	  + ??? events ??? (here?)
	- history
	- older releases	(historic)
	- help pages
	  + FAQ
	  + Docs/Tuts	(hi wbx@@ here comes your place)
	    + install docs
	  + mailing lists
	- developers
	  + wbx
	  + bsiegert
	  + cnuke
	- CVSweb	(XXX need BSDadvocacy.org fix before)
	- AnonCVS	(howto; link to)
	- Links
  alternatively, change the layout? suggestions?
  why am I the only one who cares about www?
- merge development plan
- put a "project" into the miros page head
- fix cdboot Makefile
- fix gas wanting us a.out again (wut?)
  (turned out to be a must-fix in configure.in)
- stand/cdboot/NOTES merged into stand/README
- sync distrib set lists
- have TORI device (i386 libsa) always use bounce buffers
  (which, in fact, makes it succeed in loading the kernel)
  XXX kernel says it has less than 4 meg ram (degraded mode)
  XXX may be a bochs issue?
- fix random.S again
- move determining of file name / raw file flag in both
  bios/toridev.c to the end of bios/toriopen()
  => enables us to have two drivers at once
- fix disk probing for CD devices wrt BIOS driver

(eww. The tree isn't fully broken, but neither boot
 nor cdboot.bin are usable at all at the moment.
 I'll fix that ASAP.)

<p class="admin">ATTN: Candidate for moving into MirWiki!</p>
<h1>Developer page of tyler@@</h1>

<p>
This is my MirBSD developer page, I am currently not contributing as 
much as I would like, but one of the MirBSD mirrors I do run.
<br/>
<br/><br/>
<a href="http://dero.tamu.edu">dero.tamu.edu</a> is a dual Pentium III Xeon (500Mhz) FreeBSD 4.10 server, that I use as repository...for everything. It has an external SCSI array, containing 4 10k rpm 18.2GB Seagate Cheetah drives, along with 5 7.2k rpm 9.1GB Seagate Barracuda drives. It currently resides at <a href="http://www.tamu.edu">Texas A&amp;M University</a>. (My NetSQUID/C project calls the box home ;))
<br/><br/>
Right now the box is down, until I can figure out how to get "mirbsd.tamu.edu" ;)
<br/>

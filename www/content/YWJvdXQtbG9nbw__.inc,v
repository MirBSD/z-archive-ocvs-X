<p class="admin">ATTN: Candidate for moving into MirWiki!</p>
<h1>The MirOS, Linux, BSD Logos</h1>
<h3 id="miroslogo">The new MirOS logo</h3>
<p>We are discussing about a new logo (a Schabrackentapir with a d&aelig;mon
 sitting on it, having a penguin picked up with his fork ;-), but in our
 opinion, having functional code is more important than a lousy website.</p>
<h3 id="cutedaemon">The BSD d&aelig;mon</h3>
<img src="pics/daemon.png" alt="Daemon" />
<p>The BSD d&aelig;mon picture is Copyright &copy; 1988 by Marshall Kirk
 McKusick. All Rights Reserved. Individuals may use the d&aelig;mon for
 their personal use within the bounds of good taste. When reasonably
 possible, this text is to be included.<br />If you want to mass produce
 the d&aelig;mon, for example on CDROM or T-Shirts, you need permission in
 advance. Permission to use it may be obtained from: <a
 href="http://www.mckusick.com/beastie/index.html">Marshall Kirk
 McKusick</a>, 1614 Oxford St, Berkeley, CA 94709-1608, USA or at
 <a href="mailto:mckusick@@mckusick.com">&lt;mckusick@@mckusick.com&gt;</a>.</p>
<h3 id="insanepenguin">The Linux penguin</h3>
<img src="pics/pinguin.png" alt="Penguin" />
<p>The &quot;Tux&quot; image is provided under the following notice: Permission

<h3 id="miscimages">misc &amp; images</h3>
<p>The 404 images are from the original site. The images used in CVSweb come
 with MirOS httpd 3.30A from the base system and have popped up first in
 NCSA Mosaic; they are public domain. The &quot;systemagic&quot; blowfish
 comes from the OpenBSD people.</p>
<p>Microsoft&reg; is a registered trademark of Microsoft Corp. in the USA and
 other countries; Windows might be too, but &quot;Interix&quot; definitively
 is not.</p>

the page has been updated since the last try)
also update News a bit and denote anonCVS as broken again (until it's
fixed on bsdadvocacy or we get a dedicated...)

<p>The name &quot;<tt>MirBSD</tt>&quot; and the logo image shown are private

 they obtained a permission notice, non-electronically written and signed.
 The same applies to similar images, because the base image is part of the
 &quot;look and feel&quot; of his personal homepage.</p>

@sometimes I think I am the only one working on the website,
and it took me, in fact, pretty much social engineering to
get the other people use the wlog, or even the developer info page.

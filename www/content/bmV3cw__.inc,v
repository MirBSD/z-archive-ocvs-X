<h1>Current MirOS News</h1><ul>

<li>22.01.2005<br />
	We're almost through with the new directory structure, CVS and GCC
	versions and various stages of merging and fixing. SSH still dumps
	core after exiting (forced by ProPolice), but there will be a peek
	into the new technology available for download later, which closes
	our work on ncvs I and leads to opening ncvs II back at herc.</li>

<li>07.01.2005<br />
	Benny has formally released <a href="/?ann-7">#7quinquies</a> for
	the i386 platform (build sparc from #7-stable source after having
	installed #7quater) and Thorsten fixed up the MirOS BSD kernel to
	build with gcc 3.4 and merged much more code into ncvs.</li>

<li>05.01.2005<br />
	Happy new year to all MirOS users! We've just returned from 21C3,
	the first MirHackathon's location, where we successfully built a
	macppc system cross. This night, tg@@ has also successfully built
	a local gcc 3.4 (still without ProPolice, but progressing fast).
	An exciting number of new features <b>and</b> bug fixes is being
	made in the different (and confusing) CVS branches. Stay tuned!</li>

</ul>
<p>For older news, please refer to the <a href="/?older">historical news
 page</a>, or the developers' weblog.</p>

<li>03.12.2004<br />
	CVS 1.12.10 has entered HEAD and replaces CVS 1.11.1p1 which has
	done well for ages. (Let me repeat it again: do not try to access
	a new repository with an old cvs binary or vice versa.)<br />Some
	time_t related bugs have been fixed; compat_openbsd(8) has been
	extended to the point that it successfully runs Mozilla&trade;
	Firefox&trade; and probably also Sun's native Java&trade;.</li>

<li>30.11.2004<br />
	The <a href="/?clog-2004#snap1129">new snapshot</a> is up via the
	<a href="http://f.scarywater.net/miros/">BitTorrent tracker</a>.
	Today you will get excellent download rates, tomorrow we will have
	to reduce the upstream for cost reasons. It will appear on direct
	download mirrors later. Please test test test, we haven't been able
	to do so before. Time handling looks fixed now, OpenBSD emulation
	is pretty damn stable. [UPDATE] Everything which uses rusage()
	under emulatin (Linux or OpenBSD) is still broken.</li>

<li>24.11.2004<br />
	No new snapshot yet. Problems with time handling, both in our libc
	routines (by Ohlson, DJB and me) and in format string handlings
	(such as these in libcrypto of OpenSSL fame) have further delayed
	proliferation of a &quot;known good&quot; snapshot (ie. X.509 cert
	validation broke, so I couldn't use pine or lynx).<br />Let me
	repeat: It is <strong>important</strong> that, once the new snap
	is out, you all test it. I mean it.</li>

<li>21.11.2004<br />
	A <a href="/?clog-2004#snap1121">new snapshot</a> has been released
	via <a href="http://f.scarywater.net/miros/">BitTorrent</a> and <a
	href="/?getting">direct download</a>. New features: fixed Linux and
	newly written OpenBSD 3.6-current emulation; lots of bug fixes. This
	snapshot is a &quot;known good&quot; state of MirOS #8-beta; we will
	start porting cvs-1.12 and gcc-3.4 now that this snapshot is released.
	See you at <a href="http://www.ccc.de/congress/2004/">21C3</a>!<br />
	Update: the snapshot is <strong>revoked</strong> for both bugs in the
	installer/ramdisk and <strong>corrupt</strong> time handling!</li>

<li>12.11.2004<br />
	After a week full of work, the website has been restructured. New
	versions of <a href="http://wiki.mirbsd.de/MirbsdKsh">mksh</a> (a
	temporary beta version), <a
	href="http://wiki.mirbsd.de/MirMake">make</a> (still experimental,
	but much better) and <a href="http://wiki.mirbsd.de/JuppEditor">joe
	(jupp)</a> (new) have been released; refer to the individual pages
	for a complete list of changes to these. The hbSuite performs very
	stable.</li>

<li>07.11.2004<br />
	MirDNS #2 and hbServer/hbClient for the heartbeat protocol have been
	written, alongside with a few fixes and extensions to the base system.
	There is a small speedup in the kernel (-current) and MirPorts.</li>

<li>03.11.2004<br />
	Experimental support for PHP 5 has been added to MirPorts, and a huge
	number of other ports fixed, updated or added. The kernel has received
	fixes and speed-ups, and the userland is in a better shape now as
	well. Snapshots will be announced later. [update] php5 looks good.</li>

<li>31.10.2004<br />
	The COMPAT_OPENBSD system is now ready for general gamma test
	(means, I've fixed it during alpha-test and haven't found another
	bug during beta-test, now it's your turn to help test the snapshots).
	Mirbsdksh has gained the ability to spawn on a different terminal;
	since this is for root only, it will probably be used mainly on
	rescue systems. Severe usability bugs in ssh have been fixed.<br />
	OpenBSD 3.6 is out, congrats to our upstream project! For certain
	reasons, we'd like to warn you from using inofficial ISOs or
	downloads, and urge you to buy the CDs instead. (The OpenBSD project
	does not cryptographically sign their FTP/HTTP/AFS releases or
	distribute (signed) torrents.)</li>

<li>16.10.2004<br />
	The first public snapshot of MirOS #8-beta is up. We are now at
	the stage of feature-completeness, so the only issues missing
	are to port gcc 3.4 (first coregcc), reactivate support for the
	sparc platform, make non-core gcc 3.4 running (Objective-C, C++,
	Java&trade;, Ada, Pascal, Fortran - not considered part of MirOS)
	and start release engineering.</li>

<li>11.10.2004<br />
	Waldemar Brodkorb left the project. We wish him luck for the work
	on his diploma, and hope for a nice comeback to the BSD community.
	HEAD has been deemed ripe enough for MirOS #8-beta, 1 year and two
	weeks after #7semel has been released, and exactly two years after
	MirOS #0 had been uploaded, long ago. We'll take this opportunity
	and remind you to fight against patents on algorithms, business
	models, interfaces and data structures; also we'd like to remind
	you that licencing policy should be easy, and trademark policy
	disasters such as the Mozilla&trade; one avoided.</li>

<li>09.10.2004<br />
	You are now able with MirOS HEAD to cross-compile to different
	platforms and operating systems, if you can provide include files
	and libraries. This has been verified against i386-pc-linux-gnu
	from i386-ecce-mirbsd7 using Debian GNU/Linux includes and libs.</li>

<li>25.09.2004<br />
	Good news: we've got a Strato dedicated server which will be set up
	these days in order to provide a central AnonRSYNC server to our
	mirrors and developers, and /cvs moves from the elderly Pentium-120
	(herc) to a shiny new Soekris net4801 Geode-266 box (loki).<br />
	The <tt>MirOS X.509 Certification Authority</tt> is gone; uuencode,
	md5 and ssh-keygen have undergone changes in order to supplement the
	upcoming <tt>MirPG</tt> (pgp-2.6.3 replacement written in mirbsdksh,
	depending only on tools from the base system).<br /> Many ports have
	been enhanced, updated or fixed; the system is considered <tt>stable,
	sane for general use</tt> now, although there are a few known bugs
	and security issues left.<br />We're increasing the total number of
	(in- and active) developers to seven; welcome tyler@@ to MirOS!</li>

<li>17.09.2004<br />
	Looks like most of the issues with SSP have been sorted out.
	GNU binutils have been updated, too; expect a snapshot RSN.</li>

<li>16.09.2004<br />
	Currently, there are undergoing efforts to use -fstack-protector-all
	on the system by default, yielding an even better SSP/ProPolice
	protection (and maybe the discovery of bugs, or already shortcomings
	of the system). After that, we will try to upgrade CVS to a more
	recent -stable version, sync to OpenBSD 3.6-current, import the GNU
	Compiler Collection 3.4 (or 3.5, but I don't think so) and prepare
	the long-awaited release, Codename <i>MirOS XP</i>.<br />
	MirPorts also gets some updates - a bit fresh code, bug-fixes and
	<strong>Firesomething</strong> (a certain web browser) finally
	works (tested on OpenBSD/i386).</li>

<li>29.08.2004<br />
	Happy Birthday! MirOS is now being worked on for two years. The
	linuxulator is fixed in time and SSH updated for the <a
	href="http://f.scarywater.net/miros/">birthday snapshot</a>.
	Surprise, surprise! We've got a new <a
	href="http://mirbsd.etherkiller.de/">website mirror</a> (without
	the more fancy stuff such as Wiki, CVSweb etc.) - if you encounter
	broken links, please report to the development team. Thanks.<br />
	Update: the MirPorts snapshot delivered with the birthday snapshot
	torrent does not work as-is; please upgrade. You might also want to
	update libc, because the hash functions are broken.</li>

	Since this page is intended for &quot;official press releases&quot;,
	sort of at least, there's a new news page up in the Wiki, the <a
	href="http://wiki.mirbsd.de/MirNews">collaborative MirNews</a>
	page.<br />Besides that, we're currently discussing the future of
	MirPorts w.r.t. OpenBSD Ports, and fixing some minor bugs. The
	libpng contained within the -current base system has been updated
	to fix the current security problems.</li>

<li>22.07.2004<br />
	We've got three new developers: Waldemar Brodkorb, who has helped
	out with MirPorts once, comes back after he finishes his
	"Praxissemester" at the university, being the number one responsible
	for keeping MirPorts on OpenBSD working. Stephen Paskaluk and Dave
	Steinberg from the ekkoBSD project are going to commit minor patches
	themselfes if they stumble across a thing, help with the website and
	discussion of the project's future, and Dave will continue his work
	on fdialog, a free clone of the GPL licenced dialog programme known
	to most people as the front-end of a Linux 'make menuconfig'.<br />
	We're currently working in the interna of MirOS; don't expect a new
	snapshot before mid-August. If you experience xterm crashes with
	the <a href="http://f.scarywater.net/miros/">current snapshot</a>,
	cvs up in <tt>src/X-Window/xc/programs/xterm</tt> and rebuild (I
	used imake(1) and a hack, but learned today that xmkmf(1) exists).</li>

<li>20.07.2004<br />
	The <a href="http://www.ekkoBSD.org/">ekkoBSD</a> project is no
	more, and we also had to drop some things due to lack of time
	for maintenance. The sparc port goes over board, it was just
	too slow (sorry to the XFree86 guys that I could not live up
	for my promise to build XF86 4.4.0 on sparc), and I've got to
	do enough with i386, overall, ports infrastructure, etc.<br />
	Some other things also left (gcc2, gcc3's Fortran 77, FreeBSD
	and BSD/OS personalities) or will leave the tree (gcc3's non-C
	languages), some (gcc2, gcc3) will appear as port though.
	Some major changes are undergoing, so do not build -current
	right now - it's unusable (httpd, binutils need merging).
	We promise to not "die" within the next two years or so.</li>

	An admin at BSDadvocacy has helped us restore the downloads for
	the #7ter release of MirOS BSD. Thanks.</li>

<li>02.03.2004<br />
	The following languages are now supported: C C++ Objective-C Ada
	Fortran-77. Pascal breaks (some BSD make guru out there who volunteers
	to help us finding the circular dependency I don't see?), and the
	Java&trade;-compatible subsystem is not in tree. Overall breakage
	for -current version is reduced, but for #7 users, the best bet is
	still to stick with #7bis ports. &mdash; MirPorts are now guarded
	by SYSTRACE unless overridden by a port or the user, for increased
	security and less damage done to the install.</li>

	MirOS gcc3 now supports Ada in addition to C and C++ front-ends.
	Support for Pascal, Objective C, Fortran and maybe Java&trade;
	will come as time permits. Upgrading by source is not possible.</li>

<li>25.02.2004<br />
	We have survived FOSDEM and may bring you good news:
	MirOS has been a success, we've even distributed more flyers
	than the FreeBSD project (with whom we were very friendly btw).
	Since today, MirPorts uses the SVR4 CPIO format with CRC as its
	default packaging format.<br />Please beware that MirPorts are
	currently at a stage in development where everything and his
	little brother is broken due to a broken design choice in GNU
	Libtool, Automake, Autoconf and M4 implementations and follow-up
	breakage in almost any programme. We are working on it.
	There are no issues left except for time.</li>

<li>Announcement<br />
	From 01.02.2004 onwards, announcements and other information
	to the public, will be PGP signed by one of the MirOS
	developers' keys, listed <a

	Snapshots of i386-current are almost ready. Improvements:
	new CSU from GCC3; WineX is working. Improved linking of

	(libGLU, for example). Big bug and warning fix round all
	through the base. Real fixes for X-Window.</li>

<li>20.01.2004<br />
	MirOS #7-stable was brought on track with security fixes.
	MirOS-current has been brought up to date, both MirPorts
	and GCC 3.x-wise, with OpenBSD-current (where feasible).

<li>14.01.2004<br />
	A sad thing happened: all history of MirOS prior to -current,
	except for the CVS repository, is lost forever.
	They were saved on a hard disc on mirbsd.bsdadvocacy.org, and
	could not have been backed up at our homes because of storage
	problems (no big HDDs here in .de). All binaries have been
	deleted here. We will re-upload the #7ter version, with amends
	from #7-stable, later. We will ensure integrity of the CVS
	repository mirror as soon as possible. (The hardware problems
	which caused bad checksums have been resolved on the server
	side, thanks to Josh for his good tracking down the bug.)<br />

	Asides from updating base system code with latest OpenBSD-current,
	the new package tools code is finally written and being tested,

@all files on mirbsd.bsdadvocacy.org must be refetched from a known good

everything besides the last release, current and CVS.

- provide non-GFDL-licenced as(1) and ld(1) manual pages
  XXX these are more than outdated!
- bump MirOS patchlevel
- build the system through, fixing showstoppers where
  they are encountered
- index.cgi and index.php come before index.htm,
  default.htm and index.html in httpd.conf
- speed up PHP processing
- prepare for "new" OpenBSD pkgtools (unsupported by MirBSD,
  but some MirPorts people want to play with them)
- move old weblog to CMS; update my info again
- update hRef""s in old weblogs
- move release announcements to /historic/
- copy feature list from last release announcement

  alternatively, change the layout? suggestions?
  why am I the only one who cares about www?
- merge development plan
- put a "project" into the miros page head
- fix cdboot Makefile
- fix gas wanting us a.out again (wut?)
  (turned out to be a must-fix in configure.in)
- stand/cdboot/NOTES merged into stand/README
- sync distrib set lists
- have TORI device (i386 libsa) always use bounce buffers
  (which, in fact, makes it succeed in loading the kernel)
  XXX kernel says it has less than 4 meg ram (degraded mode)
  XXX may be a bochs issue?
- fix random.S again
- move determining of file name / raw file flag in both
  bios/toridev.c to the end of bios/toriopen()
  => enables us to have two drivers at once
- fix disk probing for CD devices wrt BIOS driver

(eww. The tree isn't fully broken, but neither boot
 nor cdboot.bin are usable at all at the moment.
 I'll fix that ASAP.)

<h1>MirOS Root CA :: Policy</h1>
<h3>General Usage</h3>
<p>The MirOS Root CA is intended to verify the various servers
 contained in the MirBSD infrastructure to the client. Among these
 there are the HTTPS server at <tt>MirBSD.BSDadvocacy.org</tt>,
 the mailing list SMTP STARTTLS servers, and maybe more.</p>
<p>The certificates are given out by the head developer of MirOS,
 <a href="http://miros.66h.42h.de/tglaser/">Thorsten Glaser</a>,
 after having verified the server belongs to the MirOS project and
 the eMail address in the subjectAltName is reachable at the time
 of verification.</p>
<h3>Individuals and exceptions</h3>
<p>The certificates are given out to individuals by Thorsten Glaser
 after having verified their identity and email in the DistinguishedName
 and having seen them personally. They are only given out to
 individuals affiliated with the MirOS project.</p>
<p>Exceptions are possible if they are reasonable, but not usual.</p>
<p>The target (server or individual) of each and every certificate
 given out by the MirOS Root CA is described by an <tt>URI:certInfo</tt>
 tag in the <tt>issuerAltName</tt> section of the certificate. This
 field is intended to be non-parsable and human-readable.</p>
<h3>Distribution</h3>
<p>The Root CA certificate is part of the MirOS base installation,
 beginning with <tt>MirBSD#7</tt>. The CA CRL (Certificate Revocation
 List) is available on this server:</p>
<p><a href="ca.crl" type="application/x-x509-crl">Download the current
 CRL</a> for the MirOS Root CA in PEM format</p>
<h1>Feedback</h1>
<p>Feedback is possible by <a href="mailto:mirabile@@bsdcow.net">mailing
 the CA owner</a>.</p>

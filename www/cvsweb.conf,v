@Thanks to Josh, the new CVSweb can be activated, and the
anonRSYNC service should be available already, with
anonCVS coming later today.
Add description of how to use anonRSYNC altogether; you
can already retrieve the full CVS repository as well as
the "download area" - but please read the docs in order
to not produce too much traffic.

We (the MirOS Project) are not, and our hosters (Josh
and Codefusion IS, as well as his ISP) are NOT responsible
for the content you retrieve from our homepage (crypto
clause); you can get that from us in Germany as well (and
a German mirror should be available RSN).

<h1>MirBSD #7ter - <small>Stable Services for Commercial Customers</small></h1>

<p><strong>Attention:</strong> This is the third version of the release
 announcement, presenting the third release of the advanced BSD-derived
 operating system MirOS #7. This is a bug-fix release, which additionally
 provides support for the sparc32 architecture.</p>

<pre>homepage: <a href="https://mirbsd.bsdadvocacy.org:8890/">https://mirbsd.bsdadvocacy.org:8890/</a>
tarballs: <a href="http://mirbsd.bsdadvocacy.org/?getting">http://mirbsd.bsdadvocacy.org/?getting</a>
projects: <a href="http://www.sourcemill.com/">SourceMill: Server OS</a> (German company offering coding services and MirBSD-based servers)</pre>

<p>We are proud to announce the availability of <tt>MirOS BSD #7ter</tt>,
our latest and greatest release. MirBSD is an 4.4BSD derived personal
computer operating system inheriting Berkeley UNIX, originally developed
at the University of Berkeley. MirOS BSD #7ter is available for intel-based
computers from 80486DX or 80487SX onwards, as well as most SPARC-based
systems.<br />We, that is the MirOS and MirPorts
development team: Thorsten Glaser, Benny Siegert and Waldemar Brodkorb.</p>

<p>We would like to say thanks to the Unix Research Groups at AT&amp;T
 and Berkeley; the people involved in 4.4BSD, 386BSD, NetBSD and the
 OpenBSD team, as well as the various people who have contributed code
 and documentation (FreeBSD and ISDN4BSD, Sendmail, Apache, X Consortium,
 the Free Software Foundation and the FSF Europe, to name a few).<br />
 We would also like to thank all those people who have supported MirBSD
 in the past, including sponsoring the developers and plain downloading
 and using MirBSD.<br />
 Finally, we greet every <b>Member of the European Parliament</b> who has
 made MirOS still possible by voting against <b>Software Patents</b>.</p>

<h3>Changes</h3>

<p>Selected changes against the current development version of
 OpenBSD include:</p><ul style="list-style-type:square;">
<li>Improvements in the CVS infrastructure.</li>
<li>Slim base system: documentation and programmes that are considered
 not basic, or bloated, unnecessary or have a licence considered not free
 enough, have been removed or moved to the MirPorts framework to be
 installed later. Among these are: Kerberos IV, Kerberos V, NIS/YP, BIND 9,
 AFS/Arla, AMD, NLS/Locale/I18N; the C++, Fortran and Objective-C compilers
 of the GNU C Compiler suite 2.95.3 and everything that was licensed under
 the GNU Free Documentation License which declared front or back cover texts
 or invariant sections. Easy shortcuts have been added for people who want to
 rebuild their base system with SENDMAIL SASL or without sendmail, apache, the
 documentation, games, perl, ...</li>
<li>Several GNU utilities have been replaced by their BSD UNIX&reg;
 counterparts from AT&amp;T UNIX&reg; up to 32V, which was released by Caldera
 International, Inc. (now known as The SCO group) in 1999 under a four-clause
 UCB-style open source certified licence, in order to enable the customer to
 do with MirOS what he wants. Among these are: Groff, BC/DC, GZip, Diff.</li>
<li>Unused files (documentary, ChangeLogs, VMS and Win32 code) has been
 removed to speed up retrieving and updating the source tree.</li>
<li>Except for the compiler for the C Language, gcc 2.95 has been removed
 from the base system. The C compiler is installed as <tt>pgcc(1)</tt>
 fall-back compiler only, to prepare the move to the GNU Compiler Collection
 version 3 in the next MirOS release. - The entire base system has been made
 compilable using the fallback compiler only. No C++ code is left.</li>
<li>Since MirOS currently targets machines with an 80486DX CPU and more than
 32 MiB RAM only, and in the future will run on Pentium-class machines only.
 The sparc version has been tested on two SPARCstation 20.
 The XFree86 3.3.6 subsystem, the X11R5 and any non-i386 code have been
 removed from the tree as a consequence.</li>
<li>This eliminates potential bug sources in the base system and improves
 system stability as well as performance.</li>
<li>The Apache web server has been updated to the latest 1.3 release and
 comes with integrated support for the IPv6 Internet Protocol.</li>
<li>GNU libiberty has been updated to latest code from GCC 3.3.1 and GNU
 binutils 2.14. The GNU binutils used in-tree have been updated to 2.14.</li>
<li>The popular X11 Window Manager <tt>evilwm(1)</tt> has been updated to
 the latest version and enhanced. It is installed by default, although the
 OpenBSD <tt>fvwm(1)</tt> environment is still enabled bt default.</li>
<li>The licence for distributing the BSD d&aelig;mon and the Linux penguin
 has been obtained, so these pictures were not removed from XFree86.</li>
<li>The popular web browser <tt>lynx(1)</tt> has been updated to the latest
 development snapshot and fixed; some fixes and enhancements have been
 submitted upstream and even integrated.</li>
<li>All of the in-tree GNU software has common scripts such as a top-level
 master configure, install-sh, mkinstalldirs (from BSD) and friends moved to
 ${GNUSYSTEM_AUX_DIR} at a central place in the tree.</li>
<li>The i386 MBR (master boot record) and PBR (first-stage boot loader / partition
 boot record) code has been rewritten from scratch using the GNU assembler's
 new <tt>intel_syntax,noprefix</tt> mode. Thus it documents said mode now,
 because the GNU documentation is inaccurate and partially wrong.</li>
<li>The i386 boot code (MBR, PBR, /boot) has been extended by support for LBA and
 single-sector CHS access mode, thus supporting drives larger than 8 Gigabyte
 as well as Soekris systems and other computers with an old or broken BIOS.</li>
<li>The i386 MBR code has an optional (enabled by default) boot manager integrated
 which facilitates booting the default partition, a chosen primary partition
 on the first hard disc, or chaining to the first floppy drive. After a
 time-out of 10 seconds it boots the default partition.<br />The
 non-bootmanager MBR code can be installed by executing:<pre>

		# fdisk -ef /nonexistent wd0
		fdisk: 1&gt; u
		fdisk: 1&gt; w
		fdisk: 1&gt; q
 </pre></li>
<li>Network-bootable bsd.rd.net kernel for SPARC, eliminating the need for
 more than a RARP and TFTP d&aelig;mon on the source side.</li>
<li>Support for nearly everything the GENERIC kernel supports on the CD-ROM
 (bsd.rd) installation kernel to facilitate using it as a chroot(2) rescue
 and emergency system.</li>
<li>Installation support using FAT, ext2, ext3, UFS1 ffs, NTFS, HTTP, FTP,
 NFS as source medium. Support for PPP with kernel-mode pppd(8) on the 1440Ki
 floppy, and PPP with user-mode ppp(8) supporting ISDN SyncPPP and HDLC,
 PPP, PPPoE, PPPoA on the 2880Ki floppy/CD-ROM. Integrated support for setting
 up a RAID root system and installing to it.</li>
<li>Own set of boot floppies, kernel structured like GENERIC.</li>
<li>Support for disabling <tt>fsck(8)</tt> for ffs filesystems with softdep
 enabled (default in the MirBSD installer) in <tt>/etc/fstab</tt>.
 Includes automatic sorting of the fstab file implemented in korn shell.</li>
<li>Regular synchronization of the base system and MirPorts with OpenBSD.</li>
<li>Highly improved set of shell script infrastructure using security
 features of the Korn shell, which is <tt>/bin/sh</tt> in MirOS. Automatic
 discovery of IDE hard disc drives which need their write cache disabled.</li>
<li>Import of enhancements from NetBSD, FreeBSD and MicroBSD:</li>
<li>Improvements for the ELF executable format from NetBSD, leading to
 support for recent Wine (MS Windows&reg;) emulators.</li>
<li>Full ISDN BRI (64k*2) and PRI (T1-1536kbps and E1-2048kbps) support
 (no PRI/PMX device drivers yet) and isdnd(8) userland tool from NetBSD,
 but with unsafe string functions such as sprintf(3) removed and replaced
 by their safe counterparts (snprintf(3), strlcpy/strlcat(3)).</li>
<li>Privacy improvements: root can forbid "ps a" and "ps e" (show all users
 the processes of all users, or the environment attached to a process)</li>
<li>Allow mknod() to succeed within a chroot() unless disabled in the kernel
 configuration. This allows much cleaner release builds.</li>
<li>The <tt>CTM</tt> package, growfs(8) and ffsinfo(8), as well as some
 minor files from FreeBSD.</li>
<li>Improved wtf(1) originated from NetBSD wtf(6) with a huge acronyme
 database in two languages.</li>
<li>Always initialize variables in the kernel to 0 (from MicroBSD).</li>
<li>Integrated tinyirc and ssfe programmes (GNU) and dict (NPL) in the
 base system, facilitating easy support in the Freenode IRC network.
 Replaced unsafe string functions in these with safe counterparts.</li>
<li><tt>host(1)</tt> including a nslookup fallback compatibility script
 from the audited (prior) OpenBSD BIND4 versions.</li>
<li>hd(1) as variant of hexdump(1) with MS-DOS-alike display.</li>
<li>Lynx SSL improvements; install a bunch of well-known X509v3 Root CA
 certificates for lynx and sendmail by default.</li>
<li>sendmail comes with STARTTLS up and running by default using a snake-oil
 certificate, suggested by Thorsten Glaser and discussed with members of the
 Chaos Computer Club and Trash.net. Read starttls(8) to find out more!</li>
<li>DRI support in the X-Window subsystem. No DRM yet, though.</li>
<li>Supplied sample files: <a href="http://www.ifross.de/">ifrOSS</a> approved
 licence template to be used for newly written code in MirOS. Sample X-Window
 environment and OpenSSL CA configuration files.</li>
<li>Much enhanced COPYRIGHT file, including a summary of all advertising
 clauses that have existed in the project tree. ASCII-Art of MirOS related
 pictures. Acknowledgement to use the BSD d&aelig;mon for the project from
 Marshall Kirk McKusick. Install GNU licenses by default, too.</li>
<li>Infrastructure for supporting more than one underlying kernel/libc
 (base OS) combination, which will eventually lead to MirLinux.</li>
<li>Manpage fixes and enhancements, date display fixed and unified between
 tmac.an.old and tmac.mdoc; Makefile enhancements (make foo.E generates a
 preprocessed source file); what is now MirOS/MirPorts and started as
 OpenBSD-current-mirabile is more than one year old! - Updated papers, USD,
 PSD and SMM documentation from 4.4BSD-Alpha under the Caldera license.</li>
<li>Configuration files change: A lot of &quot;dotfiles&quot; such as
 <tt>~/.ssh</tt> have been moved (for example to <tt>~/.etc/ssh</tt>).
 More &quot;local&quot; files are supported (for example /etc/mk.conf.local,
 /etc/profile.local, /etc/changelist.local). More files are installed and
 enabled by default (for example /etc/profile, ~/.etc/ssh/known_hosts,
 /etc/mk.conf). Porters are suggested to fix their ports to obey to the
 <tt>~/.etc/</tt> structure, too.</li>
<li>Ports tree (MirPorts subsystem) enhancements:</li>
<li>&quot;Plug-In&quot; support for <tt>gcc 3.2.3</tt> in /etc/mk.conf for
 compiling software using the MirPorts framework (but not for recompiling
 the base system; that's scheduled for the next MirOS release).</li>
<li>New or enhanced ports, for example: djbdns (IPv6, VeriSign, fixes);
 Wine/WineX/XoverOffice/ReWind; CUPS; Pine; sIRC; PGP 2.6.3in; RealPlayer;
 mPlayer; DJB daemontools; Midnight Commander; CenterICQ; p5-Socket6 (for
 IPv6 sockets in perl), JOE's Own Editor v2.8, the SixXS public beta IPv6
 tunnel heartbeat client, a <strong>working K Desktop Environment, version
 3.1.1</strong> and <strong>the GNU GNOME desktop suite and developer's
 framework, version 2.4</strong>.</li>
<li>Unused, broken or old ports have been removed. There is a total of
 <strong>2521 ports available</strong> through the MirPorts framework,
 several more than under OpenBSD 3.4, but not all could have been tested.</li>
<li>Some ports removed from OpenBSD for political or broken-ness reasons
 have been resurrected: ucspi-tcp, sunjdk-1.1, flashplugin for example.</li>
<li><strong>Heads up!</strong> The OpenBSD people are still throwing stones
 into our (the MirOS project) way: the ports tree maintainers request removal
 of their names from MirPorts. This will be investigated until the next
 release. <strong>In the meanwhile I suggest avoiding OpenBSD, including
 donations to them.</strong></li>
<li>A whole lot of minor optimizations and cleanup</li>
<li>Support and development via IRC and Usenet, not through ancient ICB.</li>
<li>And no remote holes in the default maintainer in ONE year!</li></ul><p>
MirBSD #7 is only an interim release with pentium optimizations. Other
releases of MirBSD use gcc 3.x as the default compiler, with Athlon
optimizations. MirBSD/x86 runs on systems with Pentium-compatible CPU and
more than 32 Mebibytes of RAM.<br />Despite being an interim release,
MirBSD #7ter is - contrary to MirBSD #5 - designed to provide a stable,
commercially usable codebase and long-time usability, as well as an
easy upgradability to MirOS #8.</p>

<p>In order to employ the full functionality of the installer, you
will have to edit files (<tt>ppp.conf</tt>, <tt>isp</tt>/<tt>isp.chat</tt>,
<tt>isdnd.rc</tt>, <tt>raid0.conf</tt> are examples) with the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ed"><tt>ed(1)</tt></a>
editor. To ease that, this manual page is included in the installation image,
located as &quot;ed.hlp&quot; in the root directory on x86.
If you do not like the bootmanager facility, choose the <tt>(u)pdate</tt>
option in fdisk after starting it like <tt>fdisk -ef /nonexistent wd0</tt>.
If you like installing on a CCD device, add &quot;ccd0 on&quot; to
<tt>/var/run/dmesg.boot</tt> so the installer recognizes it. After creating
and enabling RAID devices, it's recommended to run &quot;raidctl -A yes
raid0&quot; (or -A root) and reboot, after which the installer should
automatically recognize it.</p>

<p>If you have support inquiries or other questions, please visit the IRC
 channel <tt>#deutsch</tt> on the Freenode PDPC (OPN) IRC network: <a
 href="http://www.freenode.net/">http://www.freenode.net/</a><br />
 From within MirBSD, simply hit &quot;tinyirc&quot;, return, &quot;/join
 #deutsch&quot; and return; please notice that root users are banned from
 using IRC for security reasons.<br />
 Another place considered a support channel for MirBSD is the usenet; more
 specifically <tt>comp.unix.bsd.misc</tt> or <tt>de.comp.os.unix.bsd</tt>.<br />
The default shell is <tt>csh</tt> for historical reasons, but can be changed
to <tt>ksh</tt> - using tcsh or GNU bash is not officially supported.</p>

<p>If you like MirOS, feel free to support the developers with an amount
 of money within your choice. Please contact us by eMail if you wish to
 do so. We're using sponsored money mainly to improve MirOS, but also
 to build up a community of open source (BSD preferred) users in the local
 area of the head developer (Bonn, Germany) as well as via IRC. Finally, we
 support our upstream code feeders, mainly OpenBSD, but also others, with
 donations - which is why you should <strong>not</strong><b> directly donate
 to the OpenBSD project for MirBSD any more</b>.</p>

<p>Enjoy it! <a href="mailto:mirabile@@bsdcow.net"><tt>Thorsten Glaser</tt></a></p>

<h2>Formalia</h2>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>The MirOS #7ter installation comes in various parts: the CD image, floppy,
 checksum file (with detached PGP signature), source and ports tarballs as from
 my development machine, as well as AnonCVS and CVSweb services (with <tt>tag:
 MIRBSD_7ter</tt>) are hosted on <tt>MirBSD.BSDadvocacy.org</tt> thanks to
 Joshua Steele, as are the installation sets, documents, CD/Floppy images,
 index files and packages.<br /> All checksums are contained in the ISO9660
 image <strong>cd34.iso</strong> as well as the detached PGP sig. The checksum
 files are signed with the PGP Key ID 0x8F1F22ED, available from the generic
 public PGP keyserver ring (for example at DFN-PCA).</p>

<p>These are hashes of the checksum file and source/ports tarballs as well as
 of the ISO installation image:</p><pre>

MD5 (i386/RMD160) =	e2d0fe0ffea119f5d57fd05d595ac376	as of
MD5 (sparc/RMD160) =	34f42612b4c1609ea0a6fd80eb0f367e	17:45 UTC

This is licence info centre for the MirOS advanced operating system
project, its offspring are the operating system variants MirBSD and
MirLinux ("MirOS BSD/Linux") as well as the MirPorts framework.
________________________________________________________________________

The MirOS project consists of the following three compilations:
o the BSD-based operating system (aka MirBSD(TM))
	consisting of a 4.4BSD derived operating system base,
	as well as some additional programmes
o the Linux-based operating system (uka MirLinux)
	consisting of the same base system MirBSD(TM) is built of,
	the Linux kernel, the GNU libc and GNU make, as well as
	some other kernel-dependent programmes
o the MirPorts framework
	based upon the OpenBSD ports tree, but not being part of the
	base system, provides a defined way to install and possibly
	deinstall third-party software into MirOS.

MirOS strives to provide an operating system open to everybody, with
as few restrictions as possible, and simple licence terms.
This is achieved by providing MirBSD to the general public.

MirOS also provides a Linux-based operating system still open for
everybody to use and redistribute, but - due to upstream package
decisions - imposes certain restrictions (namely, the force to re-
distribute source code) which touch MirBSD only tangentially (the
GNU compiler toolchain, which is not considered part of the base
system, and a few utilities) on a large part of the base system, so
it's probably not the best choice for commercial use (redistribu-
tion; usage in a company is unrestricted).

MirOS provides a freely available framework, the MirPorts system,
whose components are Makefiles, packaging informational files and
patches to the programmes installed.  The MirPorts general frame-
work is available under a BSD-style licence.
In contrast, patches usually contain code lines of third-party
software, and thus unified, context and other non-unidirectional
diff formats must be considered licenced by the same conditions as
the original file it applies to.  Unidirectional ed diffs, however,
are freely available under the same conditions as the MirPorts
framework.
Using the MirPorts systen to install third-party applications is
considered fair use - however, in most cases you cannot freely
redistribute the result (&quot;package&quot;), and in some cases, there are
restrictions imposed on distributing or even downloading the source.

The MirPorts system tries to validate the integrity of downloaded
third-party sources (&quot;distfiles&quot;) by applying checksums, however,
there is no defined way the porter can check these before making a
port, and there is no warranty whatsoever.</pre><pre class="legalbig">

The MirOS compilations are covered by the following conditions:

* Copyright (c) 2002, 2003 Thorsten Glaser &lt;x86@@ePost.de&gt;
*
* Subject to these terms, everybody who obtained a copy of this work
* is hereby permitted to deal in the work without restriction inclu-
* ding without limitation the rights to use, distribute, sell, modi-
* fy, publically perform, give away, merge or sublicense it provided
* this notice is kept and the authors and contributors are given due
* credit in derivates or accompanying documents.
* This work is provided &quot;as is&quot; with no explicit or implicit warran-
* ties whatsoever to the maximum extend permitted by applicable law;
* in no event may an author or contributor be held liable for damage
* that is, directly or indirectly, caused by the work, even if advi-
* sed of the possibility of such damage.

To the maximum extent of the editors knowledge, the MirOS system
does not contain malicious code or code which is intellectual pro-
perty of third parties.  However, both human knowledge and software
quality are limited - please be assured there is no intent to di-
stribute buggy or non-free code.  - The MirPorts tree has already
been talked about above.</pre><pre class="legalese">

The MirOS system includes work of other parties, which usually was
integrated under a 4-clause UCB-style licence.  Many authors have
since decided the third clause to be rescinded; for the sake of
completeness, it's still included below.

Portions of this compilation (the whole GNU stuff, sendmail) impose
certain limitations not covered here.  You are required to read, un-
derstand and acknowledge the licences of these tools prior to using
them.  These files can be found in /usr/share/doc/legal after in-
stalling the baseXX.tgz installation set.
Other portions, such as the Apache web server, do not really re-
strict, but rather require that derivated works are named diffe-
rently, that's why they are not listed here.

Any code referring to the &quot;AT&amp;T&quot; or &quot;Western Electric&quot; license which
has been ported from the Berkeley Software Distribution or UNIX(R)
up to 32V is covered by a four-clause UCB-style licence whose terms
are integrated below.</pre>

 know that they are meant I think (hint: I read apache logs), as well as
 the Almaden research laboratory of the IBM corporation.<br />

 <p>When MirBSD #7semel<sup>*)</sup> was released, we submitted a story to the
 Daily D&aelig;monnews magazine, and later to OSnews. It also popped up at a
 russian forum. But some person unknown to the MirOS developers has put a story
 about the release onto the &quot;OpenBSD Magazine&quot; page at www.deadly.org
 where it stayed visible and open for comments about one day. The other day,
 the story has disappeared in a sudden, with Theo de Raadt (coincidentally?)
 flaming me in private email. We got the answer "yes, it has been removed." and
 nothing else as reason, and this fishy feeling continues.<br /><b>Open Letter
 to the OpenBSD team</b>: I do like your work, and you are <b>all</b> great
 people - even these I personally despise (which are fewer than you might
 think). But I don't like that you offer people to fork if they don't like your
 OS, yet still play politics behind our backs. I know I am continuously doing
 certain things wrong, but the success may approve that. I do have a goal which
 I am following, and the other people involved are playing with MirBSD because
 it is fun to them. Please let us keep our fun. Maybe one day, you will profit
 from our code as well? Again, this is not MicroBSD, which died eventually and
 has violated licences before. This is MirBSD, a <em>wonderful</em> OS for a
 <em>peace</em>ful <em>World</em>, and we're offering our stuff back to you
 (nroff comes to mind). It's my way of developing currently, but I'm open if
 you'd like to teach me a different one - I've already been invited informally
 to the Hackathon 2003.<br />MirOS BSD #7bis will be exclusively announced at

1.1
log
@Mostly... not fully...

One weekend's worth of work.

- catch up website log with changes really done till today
- add catch-up entries for wbx@@ and bsiegert@@, too
- move GNU documentation to src/gnu/doc and simplify it
- re-run autoconf on the gnu part of the tree again, to
  catch up with the GFDL-documentation removal
- provide non-GFDL-licenced as(1) and ld(1) manual pages
  XXX these are more than outdated!
- bump MirOS patchlevel
- build the system through, fixing showstoppers where
  they are encountered
- index.cgi and index.php come before index.htm,
  default.htm and index.html in httpd.conf
- speed up PHP processing
- prepare for "new" OpenBSD pkgtools (unsupported by MirBSD,
  but some MirPorts people want to play with them)
- move old weblog to CMS; update my info again
- update hRef""s in old weblogs
- move release announcements to /historic/
- copy feature list from last release announcement
  XXX need a "readible short list", or even
  XXX	a separation for the target environment
  XXX	(e.g. suits / techies / clients)
- add some recent news, so the page ain't empty
  missing:
	- about
	  + MirOS
	  + MirPorts
	- get MirOS!	(http d/l, http install, install docs)
	- relations	(to other BSD)
	  + ??? events ??? (here?)
	- history
	- older releases	(historic)
	- help pages
	  + FAQ
	  + Docs/Tuts	(hi wbx@@ here comes your place)
	    + install docs
	  + mailing lists
	- developers
	  + wbx
	  + bsiegert
	  + cnuke
	- CVSweb	(XXX need BSDadvocacy.org fix before)
	- AnonCVS	(howto; link to)
	- Links
  alternatively, change the layout? suggestions?
  why am I the only one who cares about www?
- merge development plan
- put a "project" into the miros page head
- fix cdboot Makefile
- fix gas wanting us a.out again (wut?)
  (turned out to be a must-fix in configure.in)
- stand/cdboot/NOTES merged into stand/README
- sync distrib set lists
- have TORI device (i386 libsa) always use bounce buffers
  (which, in fact, makes it succeed in loading the kernel)
  XXX kernel says it has less than 4 meg ram (degraded mode)
  XXX may be a bochs issue?
- fix random.S again
- move determining of file name / raw file flag in both
  bios/toridev.c to the end of bios/toriopen()
  => enables us to have two drivers at once
- fix disk probing for CD devices wrt BIOS driver

(eww. The tree isn't fully broken, but neither boot
 nor cdboot.bin are usable at all at the moment.
 I'll fix that ASAP.)

1.1.2		FSF		The Free Software Foundation
1.1.3		tg		MirOS: Thorsten Glaser
1.1.4		bsiegert	MirOS: Benny Siegert
1.1.5		netbsd		The NetBSD(TM) foundation
1.1.6		freebsd		The FreeBSD uhm...
1.1.7		wbx		MirOS: Waldemar Brodkorb
1.1.8		ASF		The Apache(TM) Software Foundation
1.1.9		xc		The X Consortium, or XFree86 people, etc.

			Behaviour
			=========

* Whoever breaks XHTML/1.1 compliance will get problems.

* People with access to only a limited area of their tree have
  to not commit outside (e.g. their module, or branch).

@allocate branch 1.1.9 for
 - The X Consortium
 - The XFree86 Project
 - probably the Xouvert people, too
 - maybe freedesktop.org and others

ie, anything suitable for src/X-Window/xc/

* CVS Import is to be avoided. Ask bsiegert@@ for why, he has
  learned it the hard way.

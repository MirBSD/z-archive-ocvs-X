@add another piece of History of MirOS
reaching back to 2002.12.03.20.06.42
(this file is the visible commit; the
rest has been cp'd into /ocvs because
it's in RCS format anyway)

This directory contains historic versions of MirOS.
The files you can retrieve directly via CVS are not
the historic content but the RCS files which I have
directly copied to the CVS root.

These files are provided as usual, without warranty
of any kind, you know. Back then, licencing was not
too important; the entire content of this directory
is either OpenBSD context (for diff) or provided by
Thorsten Glaser under the new MirOS licence.

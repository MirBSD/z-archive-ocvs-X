@major reorganisation of the contrib/ structure
easier directory paths; code/ for MirSoftware
XXX still a bit uneasy about gfdl-docs, but a
XXX solution will come with the new gcc I think

# This script produces an "ed2k" type URI for a given existing file.
# It is by no means normative, but developed by reverse engineering.
#
# Structure of an "ed2k" type URI:
#  ed2k://|file|<filename>|<size>|<hash>|[/]
# where the trailing slash is optional, "filename" is posix, except
# that no pipe sign can occur, size in octets (decimal) and hash...
# well, that's the hard part below. It's hexadecimal lowercase.

@wow, replaced "sed s/\|//g" by three lines of shell,
thus saving another fork/exec combo (speed up!)
and validating filenames

@well... I finally managed to compose the "ed2k" class URIs in shell.
A bit of tragedy is the signed-32bit limit for shell variable integers.

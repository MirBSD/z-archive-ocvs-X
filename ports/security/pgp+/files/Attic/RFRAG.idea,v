   If you are a commercial or gouvernment user in the USA,

@* improve
* add no_idea flavour
  -> since IDEA is being used to encrypt private keys, as
     well as in the random generator process, this was a
     no-no; I might come back to this idea later, though
* add README.MirPorts
* add entropy from /dev/urandom on UNIX® systems

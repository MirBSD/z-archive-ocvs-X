@* improve
* add no_idea flavour
  -> since IDEA is being used to encrypt private keys, as
     well as in the random generator process, this was a
     no-no; I might come back to this idea later, though
* add README.MirPorts
* add entropy from /dev/urandom on UNIX® systems

@      Pretty Good Privacy version 2.6.3in (world wide use extended)

PGP 2.6.3in is not an official PGP version. It is based on the source
code for MIT PGP 2.6.2 and has been modified for world wide use. PGP
2.6.3i (international) is legal in the United States after September 6,
2000 (when RSA Security, Inc. placed its public key encryption algo-
rithm in the public domain). The only fact preventing this version from
being used commercially is the patent on IDEA by Ascom Tech, Switzerland.

For more detailed information about licencing, please refer to the file
README.MirPorts, and for a more thorough installation and usage guide,
refer to the file setup.doc and the documentation for PGP 2.6.2, which is
included unmodified in the doc/ subdirectory that is created when you
unpack the distribution archive and installed in /usr/local/share/doc.

@Merge import of OpenBSD source, ports and XF4 tree.

While here,
o clean up differences where possible
o whitespace cleanup
o ifdef ./. if defined()
o '...' ./. "..."
o echo foo > bar ./. echo foo >bar
o `...` ./. $(...) ./. $$(...)
o `...' ./. '...'
o modernize "our" tree, e.g. WWW in ports
o fix some typos and brainos introduced when renaming OpenBSD to MirBSD
o use hardware 80387 by default
o migrate Apache 1.3.28 OpenBSD ./. MirBSD ./. KAME
o work around as many CVS bugs as possible (add back/delete files, ...)

Synchronize stuff, ready for ongoing changes.

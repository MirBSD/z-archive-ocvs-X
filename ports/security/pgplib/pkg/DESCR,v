@  PGPlib is a library that lets you generate (and manipulate) PGP
  packets without having to run PGP.  In particular there is code to
  generate and understand the following types of PGP packets:

  - Data can be signed with a private key
  - Data can be encrypted with a public key
  - Data encrypted with your public key can be decrypted
  - You can verify signatures on public keys and on buffers (files)
  - Convential encrypted (IDEA with Zimmermann's context sensitive
    feedback).  The library can both read (decrypt) and write
    (encrypt) convential packets (in PGP format)
  - Armor.  You can (de)armor a buffer or a file into a buffer or a
    file
  - UserID packets are read and written in a variety of formats
  - Literal with filename, mode, etc.  You can create literate
    packages from files, or from buffers, and create files from
    literate packets
  - Keys can be obtained from a database (which is provided) or by
    parsing keyrings.  Keys can be kept in buffers or on files
  - You can maintain a PGP public-key database (I use this library to
    maintain a database with ~40.000 keys).  There is code to use DBM
    as supplied from Berkeley.  A copy of DBM is included for your
    convenience

  In general, PGPlib operates on buffers in order for you to use it in
  your applications.

  I have made a small program that will (de)armor anything, a parser
  to parse PGP files (including decryption and so on), a shell to
  manipulate a keydatabase, a keyserver to run on top of such a
  database, a program to verify signatures on keys and/or files, a
  program to split keyrings in smaller parts and a program that will
  sign files for you.  You will find all these (and many more) in the
  PGPlib-1.1/applications/ directory.  None of these uses PGP as they 
  are linked with PGPlib, which provides all the functionality that is
  needed.

  I believe that all parts of the library is tested against PGP by the
  script PGPlib-1.1/applications/test.sh.  You need to edit it in 
  order to make it run (to ensure that you read my warnings, sorry 
  about this).


What is not there for you
=========================

  - Sufficient documentation.

  I have written this library because I need it.  In order to make
  life less hard for my students, I will have to provide some
  documentation.  Possibly even on-line.  However, quite a few manual
  pages are included in the PGPlib-1.1/man/ directory.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

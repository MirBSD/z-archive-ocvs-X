@Fix stupid typos and punctuation errors in install scripts. It seems that
all INSTALL files in the ports tree stem from the same one, and they all
share the same mistakes. Sigh.
Add MirBSD tags in changed files.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Initial revision

@libmcrypt is the library which implements all the algorithms and
modes found in mcrypt. It is currently under development but it
seems to work pretty good.

Unlike most encryption libraries libmcrypt does not have everything
(random number generators, hashes, hmac implementation, key exchange,
public key encryption etc.).  libmcrypt only implements an interface
to access block and stream encryption algorithms.

Its purpose was to assist in the development of mcrypt by providing
a uniform interface to access several different encryption algorithms,
so that the main program is independent of the encryption algorithms
and the modes used.

libmcrypt supports the algorithms: BLOWFISH, TWOFISH, DES, TripleDES,
3-WAY, SAFER-sk64, SAFER-sk128, SAFER+, LOKI97, GOST, RC2, RC6,
MARS, IDEA, RIJNDAEL-128 (AES), RIJNDAEL-192, RIJNDAEL-256, SERPENT,
CAST-128 (known as CAST5), CAST-256, ARCFOUR and WAKE.  Block
algorithms can be used in: CBC, ECB, CFB and OFB (8 bit and n bit,
where n is the size of the algorithm's block length).

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Now we can update MirPorts from OpenBSD ports tree again,
that we have fixed pkg_install tools accordingly in both
stable and current, and that these tools are compatible.

Consider MirPorts locked until next commit of ports/INDEX,v

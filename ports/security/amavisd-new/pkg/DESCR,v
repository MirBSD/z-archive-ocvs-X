log
@new port. amavisd-new is the software component between mta and mailcontentchecker
as clamav antivirus or spamassassin. at the moment there is no flavour for sendmail
milter api, and this is only tested with postfix2.

the port _only_ work with MirBSD-current, because it depends on perl 5.8.2.

the port will install clamav and spamassassin.

text
@amavisd-new is a high-performance interface between mailer 
(MTA) and content checkers: virus scanners, and/or 
SpamAssassin. It is written in Perl for maintainability, 
without paying a significant price for speed. It talks to 
MTA via (E)SMTP or LMTP, or by using helper programs. Best
with Postfix, fine with dual-sendmail setup and Exim v4,
works with sendmail/milter, or with any MTA as a SMTP relay.
'Howto' for qmail available as well.

1.1
log
@new port. amavisd-new is the software component between mta and mailcontentchecker
as clamav antivirus or spamassassin. at the moment there is no flavour for sendmail
milter api, and this is only tested with postfix2.

the port _only_ work with MirBSD-current, because it depends on perl 5.8.2.

the port will install clamav and spamassassin.

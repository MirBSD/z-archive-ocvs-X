@- new upstream version
- corrected dependencies to new db4 port
- tested with postfix2 client authentication (PLAIN)
- compiles fine with sendmail (can someone verify it please!)

I have no idea how to make correct patches for upstream developers.
After a long autoconf/libtool analysis, I think the problem is the following:
- libc from MirBSD includes resolver functionality
- autoconf tests didn't fail when -lresolv is added to the compiler
- libtool try to resolv all shared library dependencies for dynamic loaded
  libraries (sasl-plugins) and fail, because libresolv.so is not found.
  On Linux systems there is such a library.

The macro AC_CHECK_LIB(resolv,res_search) is the problem.
It is defined in autoconf/libs.m4, a standard macro for software using
autotools.

any ideas are welcome...

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

note: this brings us new users (hint: /etc/master.passwd)

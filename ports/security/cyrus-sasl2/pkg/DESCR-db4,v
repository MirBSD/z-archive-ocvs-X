@SASL is the Simple Authentication and Security Layer, a method for adding
authentication support to connection-based protocols. To use SASL, a
protocol includes a command for identifying and authenticating a user to a
server and for optionally negotiating protection of subsequent protocol
interactions. If its use is negotiated, a security layer is inserted
between the protocol and the connection.
This module adds support for Berkeley DB.

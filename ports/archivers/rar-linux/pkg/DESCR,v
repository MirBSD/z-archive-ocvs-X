@This is the statically linked GNU/Linux binary of the
commercial RAR archiver, currently the only way to
extract the most recent RAR archives.

RAR is shareware; you must register or de-install it
after 40 days of use. Please read the accompanying
file ${PREFIX}/share/doc/rar/license.txt for details.

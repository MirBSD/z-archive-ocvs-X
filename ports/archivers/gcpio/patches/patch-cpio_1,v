@@@@ -32,16 +32,16 @@@@ cpio \- copy files to and from archives
 This manual page
 documents the GNU version of
 .BR cpio .
-.B cpio
+.B gcpio
 copies files into or out of a cpio or tar archive, which is a file that
 contains other files plus information about them, such as their
 file name, owner, timestamps, and access permissions.  The archive can
 be another file on the disk, a magnetic tape, or a pipe.
-.B cpio
+.B gcpio
 has three operating modes.
 .PP
 In copy-out mode,
-.B cpio
+.B gcpio
 copies files into an archive.  It reads a list of filenames, one per
 line, on the standard input, and writes the archive onto the standard
 output.  A typical way to generate the list of filenames is with the
@@@@ -52,7 +52,7 @@@@ the \-depth option to minimize problems 
 directories that are unwritable or not searchable.
 .PP
 In copy-in mode,
-.B cpio
+.B gcpio
 copies files out of an archive or lists the archive contents.  It
 reads the archive from the standard input.  Any non-option command
 line arguments are shell globbing patterns; only files in the archive
@@@@ -63,14 +63,14 @@@@ can match wildcards.  If no patterns are
 extracted.
 .PP
 In copy-pass mode,
-.B cpio
+.B gcpio
 copies files from one directory tree to another, combining the
 copy-out and copy-in steps without actually using an archive.
 It reads the list of files to copy from the standard input; the
 directory into which it will copy them is given as a non-option
 argument.
 .PP
-.B cpio
+.B gcpio
 supports the following archive formats: binary, old ASCII, new
 ASCII, crc, HPUX binary, HPUX old ASCII, old tar, and POSIX.1 tar.  
 The binary format 
@@@@ -86,7 +86,7 @@@@ currently, it is only supported by GNU a
 The crc format is
 like the new ASCII format, but also contains a checksum for each file
 which
-.B cpio 
+.B gcpio 
 calculates when creating an archive
 and verifies when the file is extracted from the archive.
 The HPUX formats are provided for compatibility with HPUX's cpio which
@@@@ -102,18 +102,18 @@@@ The POSIX.1 tar format can not be used t
 than 255 characters (less unless they have a "/" in just the right place).
 .PP
 By default,  
-.B cpio
+.B gcpio
 creates binary format archives, for compatibility with
 older
 .B cpio
 programs.
 When extracting from archives,
-.B cpio
+.B gcpio
 automatically recognizes which kind of archive it is reading and can
 read archives created on machines with a different byte-order.
 .PP
 Some of the options to
-.B cpio
+.B gcpio
 apply only to certain operating modes; see the SYNOPSIS section for a
 list of which options are allowed in which modes.
 .SS OPTIONS
@@@@ -164,7 +164,7 @@@@ Create leading directories where needed.
 In copy-in mode, read additional patterns specifying filenames to
 extract or list from FILE.  The lines of FILE are treated as if they
 had been non-option arguments to
-.BR cpio .
+.BR gcpio .
 .TP
 .I "\-f, \-\-nonmatching"
 Only copy files that do not match any of the given patterns.
@@@@ -322,5 +322,5 @@@@ Print a "." for each file processed.
 .TP
 .I "\-\-version"
 Print the
-.B cpio
+.B gcpio
 program version number and exit.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

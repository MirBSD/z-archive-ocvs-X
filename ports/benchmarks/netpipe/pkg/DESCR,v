@NetPIPE is a protocol independent performance tool that encapsulates
the best of ttcp and netperf and visually represents the network
performance under a variety of conditions. By taking the end-to-end
application view of a network, NetPIPE clearly shows the overhead
associated with different protocol layers. Netpipe answers such
questions as: how soon will a given data block of size k arrive at its
destination? Which network and protocol will transmit size k blocks
the fastest? What is a given network's effective maximum throughput
and saturation level?  Does there exist a block size k for which the
throughput is maximized? How much communication overhead is due to the
network communication protocol layer(s)? How quickly will a small (< 1
kbyte) control message arrive, and which network and protocol are best
for this purpose?

For a paper fully describing NetPIPE and sample investigation of
network performance issues using NetPIPE, see

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>SpamAssassin mini-howto</TITLE><META NAME="generator" CONTENT="txt2html v1.28"></HEAD><BODY>

<p><b>Usage:</b><br>

You can use spamassassin in many ways. But the lightest for the machine is by
making use of the spamc/spamd combination.

<p>Add this line to <b><code>/etc/rc.local</b></code>:
<pre><b># /usr/local/bin/spamd -u _spamdaemon -d -L -p 4321 -x</b></pre>
<br> Use that same line to start spamd now.

<p>The final step: put this at the top of your <b><code>.procmailrc</b></code>.
If you do not want to use procmail please check the
 <A HREF="http://spamassassin.org/doc.html">online docs</A>

<ul><pre>
:0fw
* < 256000
| spamc -p 4321 -f

:0e
{
EXITCODE=$?
}

:0:
* ^X-Spam-Status: Yes
caughtspam # This is the mailbox where all spam goes.</pre></ul>

<p><b>Customizing:</b><br>

The spam filtering is not perfect. But since the feedback is very extensive you
should be able to do what is necessary to get most spam filtered. 

<p>If you want to add custom settings to spamassassin you can create the 
file<code><b> /etc/spamassassin.cf </b></code>. All possible options are 
described in:<code><b> man Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf</b></code>


<p><b>Much more info:</b><br>

This is just a mini-HOWTO to get you up and running if you are in a hurry.
Please go to <A HREF="http://spamassassin.org">spamassassin.org</A> for further
information.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Now we can update MirPorts from OpenBSD ports tree again,
that we have fixed pkg_install tools accordingly in both
stable and current, and that these tools are compatible.

Consider MirPorts locked until next commit of ports/INDEX,v

@WMbiff displays the status of up to five mailboxes. It gives information
about new mail, if any, or total number of messages. It also has mail retrieval
capabilities, and can be configured to do this automatically. At the moment,
UNIX-style, POP3 and IMAP4 mailboxes are supported. WMbiff also supports Licq
history files, displaying the number of new messages in your running Licq
session, as if they were mail.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

WMBiff is an WindowMaker dock applet that displays the number of read
and unread messages in up to five mailboxes.  You can define actions to
execute on new mail arrival (for example, play a sound file),
[auto]fetchmail from a remote server or execute your mail reader with a
mouse click.  WMBiff also supports polling the output of shell commands,
so you can extend its functionality easily via shell scripts.  At this
time, wmbiff supports unix-style, maildir, pop3, APOP, IMAP, IMAPS and
mailboxes, as well as Licq and GnomeICU history files.

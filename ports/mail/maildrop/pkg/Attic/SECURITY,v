@move ports/mail/* and ports/news/* to ports/mailnews/*
@
text
@Maildrop must be run as the uid/gid of the user whose mailbox it
is delivering to.

Therefore, if the MTA does not spawn it with the correct uid/gid,
it needs to be suid root to perform the operation itself.

The port is installed with the suid bit stripped by default.  This
works out-of-the-box with MTAs like qmail, which spawn maildrop
with the correct uid/gid it needs to perform the delivery.

For more information, please read the documentation in
${PREFIX}/share/doc/maildrop/INSTALL.  It should be safe to enable
the suid bits, but scan over the code first and satisfy yourself
that there are no security holes.

If you perform a full audit, please inform <ports@@openbsd.org> and
the suid bit may then be enabled by default.  Note that there have
been no security advisories about this package in the past.

The following files will need suid re-enabled if you so choose:

${PREFIX}/bin/maildrop
${PREFIX}/bin/dotlock
${PREFIX}/bin/reformail

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

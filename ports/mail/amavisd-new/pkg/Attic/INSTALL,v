@The day I'll allow ports to set sysctls or add/remove users/groups,
you know will be the day after the day I became member in the
OpenBSD core team.

We don't have USE_GCC3 either. (guilib, sdlmm and smpeg want mirlibtool.)

 * games/xonix: privilege escalation
 * archivers/lha: buffer overflow
 * mail/exim: buffer overflows
 * net/rsync: path checking issue

@Mozilla Thunderbird is a redesign of the Mozilla mail component.
Our goal is to produce a cross platform stand alone mail application
using the XUL user interface language. Our intended customer is
someone who uses Mozilla Firebird (or another stand alone browser)
as their primary browser and wants a mail client based on mozilla
that "plays nice" with the browser.

Mozilla Thunderbird is a redesign of the integrated Mozilla App-Suite
mail component. Its goal is to leverage much of the existing
functionality of that product to produce a stand-alone mail application
that is simple and extensible.

Thunerbird looks for plugins in ~/.mozilla/plugins
${LOCALBASE}/mozilla-thunderbird/plugins
and ${LOCALBASE}/lib/mozilla-plugins.

To make it look good you probably want some nice anti-aliased fonts,
like ${PORTSDIR}/x11/bitstream-vera-fonts.
To disable xft altogether set GDK_USE_XFT=0 in the environment.

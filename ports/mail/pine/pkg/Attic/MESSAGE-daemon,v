@The ipop2d, ipop3d, and imapd daemons should be invoked by your
/etc/inetd.conf file with lines such as:

  pop2	stream	tcp	nowait	root	${PREFIX}/libexec/ipop2d	ipop2d
  pop3	stream	tcp	nowait	root	${PREFIX}/libexec/ipop3d	ipop3d
  imap	stream	tcp	nowait	root	${PREFIX}/libexec/imapd 	imapd


To use SSL as default transport you need to add the lines below to
/etc/inetd.conf.

  pop3s	stream	tcp	nowait	root	${PREFIX}/libexec/ipop3d	ipop3d
  imaps	stream	tcp	nowait	root	${PREFIX}/libexec/imapd 	imapd

You also need to install files containing an RSA certificate and private key
to /etc/ssl/ipop3d.pem and /etc/ssl/imapd.pem. See ssl(8) for how to do this.

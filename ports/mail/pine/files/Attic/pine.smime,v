#-
# S/MIME support for pine, main module
#
# Documentation:
# Set pine up so it uses this script as its mail submission agent
# (use sendmail-path=/usr/local/bin/pine.smime option in .pinerc)
# You can pass additional args to sendmail by setenv SMIMEARGS.
# Start pine via the pine.smime.init script, it will ask you
# for your password you protected your S/MIME key with.
# The key and cert have to reside in ~/.etc/ssh/mime.{key,cer}
# If you want to add e.g. your CA Certificate(s) to the signed
# messages, as other mailers usually do, use ~/.etc/ssh/mime.ca
# Add "X-SMIME: NO" to your pine user-defined headers to ease later use.
#
# To send a signed mail, press ^R (Rich Headers) in Composer and change
# "X-SMIME: No" to a value not containing "NO" or "OPAQ" (case-insensitive).
# If you choose OPAQ, the clear-signing will be deactivated, i.e.
# the message will only be visible to S/MIME capable clients.
#
# If you receive a S/MIME mail, do the following manually, because
# there is no way to automate it in pine:
# press | (PIPE), set to RAW if not yet set (press ^W), set
# the command to the following and execute:
#  openssl smime -verify
# To decrypt an incoming message, you may use
#  openssl smime -decrypt -certfile ~/.etc/ssh/mime.cer -inkey ~/.etc/ssh/mime.key
# Note: "Verification Successful\n" can be anywhere in the viewer body
#  because it is put to stderr and pine is, err, slightly buggy.
#  So you should use the unverified part of the message, or, for opaquely
#  signed messages, s/Verification Successful\n// after saving.
#
# Support for encrypting outgoing messages is not planned until there is
# some way to retrieve information from within this script.
# Probably it could be done by a header.
#
# If something goes wrong, you'll find a file called ~/smime.log

1.3
log
@this directory is now 100% superfluous

XXX there are only 27 port-flavours which are USE_LIBTOOL=Yes
maybe we can get rid altogether of libtool 1.3?
this area should be worth some investigation...

1.2
log
@add mirbsd* and ekkobsd* here, too
this fixes devel/glib and probably 40-80% of the other
ports too, which would otherwise have needed kludges
such as the one in gettext, iconv etc.

PS: with_gnu_ld=no is only openbsd...

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

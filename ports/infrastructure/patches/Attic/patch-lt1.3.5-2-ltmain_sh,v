1.2
log
@this directory is now 100% superfluous

XXX there are only 27 port-flavours which are USE_LIBTOOL=Yes
maybe we can get rid altogether of libtool 1.3?
this area should be worth some investigation...

1.1
log
@this is a more common way to do it:
 - switch port from gnu to autoconf
   (attention: look at the version denoted in configure,
    this one here wants 2.13 so no version in Makefile)
 - use patches from infrastructure
   (apparently, there are two differing libtool-1.3.5
    sources around, *sigh*)

tested to make package

@sort and remove create-user
XXX does anyone use or maintain this?
@
text
@This directory does not hold ports, but rather stuff to help
with building specific ports, or with checking packages.

Better documentation will be written as this progresses.

Quick list of what exists, most useful stuff first

build/bundle-readmes:
	create README.html files and bundle them as one tar archive.

build/find-build-order
	used such as cat plist/i386 | build/find-build-order
	outputs a list of stuff that actually needs to be built to obtain those
	packages, in a suitable order for removing backward dependencies.

	Optional arg `build' or `run' to take only build or run dependencies
	into account.

	Major defect: tsort is not a stable sort, so find-build-order will
	rearrange the list it gets as input.

build/out-of-date
	compare installed registered packages with INDEX, try to find out
	of date ports.

build/outdated-perl-ports
	compare perl ports INDEX entries with the latest module
	versions available from CPAN

db/network.conf
	Distfiles configuration. Tweakable by the user

fetch/check-distfiles
	heuristic to check the whole contents of /usr/ports/distfiles against
	all MD5 files in the ports tree.

fetch/check-license
	legacy script used by Marco to check the LICENSE files

install/make-plist
	perl helper for the make plist target

packages/check-dependencies
	Check dependencies for all packages in the current directory.
	Basically, verifies that the tsort in bsd.port.mk did their job.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import OpenBSD ports tree checked out from anoncvs.ca.openbsd.org at
2004-05-28 15:30 UTC.

Lots of SECURITY fixes, at least:

 * databases/mysql: tmpfile issue
 * www/squid: acl bypass
 * games/xonix: privilege escalation
 * archivers/lha: buffer overflow
 * mail/exim: buffer overflows
 * net/rsync: path checking issue
 * net/icecast: buffer overflow
 * www/opera

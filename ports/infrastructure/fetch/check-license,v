# Output is three lists:

#  Missing files:	files that should be in the directory (if the
#			intent is to obtain all files that can be
#			re-distributed) but are not.
#
#  Bad files:		files that must NOT be in a distribution
#			directory.  These are listed in the form
#			of a shell `mv -f xxx ../licensed' command so

#			verification) to move them into a directory
#			that will not be copied to any CD-ROM.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

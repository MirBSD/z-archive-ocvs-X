@from openbsd, on special wish of bsiegert@@:
Allow full path for modules, like this:
MODULES=devel/gettext
so that:
- stubs in infrastructure/ are no longer needed.
- PORTSDIR_PATH is taken into account.

This will look for ${PORTSDIR}/devel/gettext/gettext.port.mk

okay naddy@@

@who's afraid of Makefiles?
Not me.

Implement stuff for new, more portable, more flexible MirPorts
and os-dependant infrastructure; fix indenting, use \${SHELL},
have a baseline of sane defaults, etc.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

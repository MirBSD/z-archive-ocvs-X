@o unlock the ports framework again
o sync (2493 ports)
o small changes in the framework base for allowing
  a more flexible use for the MAINTAINER variable
o nuke 60 char limit on pkgname
  (make up to 72, and fix an off-by-one)
o fix a few leftover hung lines from removal ed script

[ read on for the full story ]

nuke all the OpenBSD guys (listed below), except those
who did not (my mail to ports@@ was enough to notify
everyone, since it's a list every porter is obliged
to subscribe to)

in contrast, the MirPorts framework is now covered by
a standard MirOS-style licence (see the template).

@it's over, people

Usually, the BSD community _never_ removes credits (the MirOS COPYRIGHT
file being a pretty good example for that fact). However, the OpenBSD
people required me to remove their names from the MirPorts framework,
where it got imported to from the OpenBSD ports tree, and declared as
contributor of the port to OpenBSD. I can understand their privacy is-
sues, but still am not easy with this decision. However, I have to obey.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@WineX is an emulator for the Microsoft Windows series of
operating systems and graphical user interfaces. There
are three variants of this emulator available:

 - Wine: the original one. The licence has changed from
	 BSD-like to LGPL at some time in the past. [0]

 - ReWind: the classic one. Forked from Wine just before
	   the licence change, developed independently.

 - WineX: the gamer's heaven. A weird mix of components
	  from Wine, ReWind, InstallShield and other stuff.
	  Designed to eventually run any Windows game.

 - Codeweavers Crossover Office: commercially enhanced
	emulator suite with apparently good support for
	Microsoft Office and others. Linux binary.  [1]

All ports require
	# sysctl -w machdep.userldt=1

[0] Wine relies on the configuration file /etc/wine.conf to
    contain valid assignments of Unix directories to DOS drive
    letters, and for certain other options (see "man wine" for
    details). You will most probably have to edit it after the install...

[1] This port is merely a proof of concept than a clean port;
    additionally, the suite wants to be installed in
		/opt/cxoffice
    (but if you export CX_HOME=${PREFIX}/cxoffice, it
    should work as-is).

MirPorts favours an antique Wine version known to work
under OpenBSD, as well as pretty recent Rewind and WineX
versions on which is currently being worked. The Xover
port does not currently work because of missing syscalls.

Wine is a Windows emulator running under Unix on i386 (and higher) CPUs.
It is still Alpha quality, i.e. don't expect it to run your typical large 
MS-Windows application package, but it is definitely on its way ...

To use Wine, you need to enable the machdep.userldt sysctl, either via
/etc/sysctl.conf, or by entering (as root):
    sysctl -w machdep.userldt=1

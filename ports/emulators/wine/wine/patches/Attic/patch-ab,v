1.2
log
@ew. time_t64 and gcc3 fixes, as well as regenerating patches.
still not much of a progress. can't play:
	fixme:win32:PE_LoadImage Need to relocate C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\SOL.EXE, but no relocation records present (stripped during link).
	wine: can't exec 'sol.exe': error=0
wine progman also doesn't work (can't find its licence).

@these "LIVE.COM streaming libraries" I could have needed on the congress
@
text
@This code forms a set of C++ libraries for multimedia streaming, using open
standard protocols (RTP/RTCP, RTSP, SIP). These libraries - which can be
compiled for Unix (including Linux and Mac OS X), Windows, and QNX (and other
POSIX-compliant systems) - can be used to build streaming applications. The
libraries are already being used to implement applications such as
"liveCaster" and "playRTPMPEG" (for streaming MP3 audio using RTP/RTCP), and
"vobStreamer" (for streaming DVD content using RTP/RTCP/RTSP). The libraries
can also be used to stream, receive, and process MPEG, H.263+ or JPEG video,
and several audio codecs. They can easily be extended to support additional
(audio and/or video) codecs, and can also be used to build basic RTSP or SIP
clients and servers, and have been used to add streaming support to existing
media player applications, such as "MPlayer".

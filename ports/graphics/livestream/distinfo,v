@Update to latest version - this time, mirrored at our master site, too.
Changes:

2004.01.23:
- Changed "RTSPServer" to include a "Content-Base:" header in "DESCRIBE"
  responses.  This overcomes a bug in QuickTime Player, which sends incorrect
  "SETUP" URLs otherwise.
- Fixed a bug in "MPEG4VideoStreamFramer" that was causing some frames
  to erroneously be given a duration of 0.

2004.01.22:
- Made another improvement to the "RTSPServer" implementation.  It once again
  properly handles streams without a stream name (i.e., where the "streamName"
  parameter to "ServerMediaSession::createNew()" was NULL.
- Updated the (little-used) "ByteStreamMultiFileSource" class to take
  "preferredFrameSize" and "playTimePerFrame" parameters, just like
  "ByteStreamFileSource".  Also added a member function to ask whether
  a new file has just been read from.

2004.01.21:
- Made several improvements/bugfixes to the "RTSPServer" implementation:
  - Worked around an apparent bug in QuickTime Player: It sometimes
  doesn't include a proper URL in RTSP "SETUP" requests.
  - Corrected the 'frame' (really tick) rate and frame duration that
  are computed for 'fixed_vop_rate' MPEG-4 video streams.
  - Compensated for some buggy MPEG-4 video streams that don't set
  timestamp information properly.
- MPEG-4 video end codes will now be included in the outgoing RTP stream,
  and received properly by RTSP clients.
- Fixed "RTSPClient" to be more tolerant of RTSP "Transport:" headers that
  contain more than one successive ';' character.  (Darwin Streaming Server
  sometimes does this.)

2004.01.19:
- Changed "RTSPServer" to not create per-session state when handling
  "DESCRIBE", but instead to wait until "SETUP".  This fixes a problem
  that was causing the "VLC" media player to fail to work with our
  "RTSPServer" implementation, because VLC uses one RTSP TCP connection
  to do the "DESCRIBE", and then another to do "SETUP" and "PLAY".
  (Thanks to Emmanuel Dufour for pointing this out.)
- Updated "MPEG4VideoStreamFramer" to include the VIDEO_SEQUENCE_END_CODE
  in the output stream if it sees it in the input.

2004.01.10:
- Fixed the "RTSPServer" implementation to properly return a "server_port" field
  in the RTSP "SETUP" response for unicast streams.  Also, the server ports
  (RTP and RTCP) are now chosen separately, and will no longer be the same
  as the client ports if the client and server are running on the same machine.
  (That did not work on some Linux systems.)
- Fixed a bug in "MP3ADU" that was causing frame durations to not be set properly
  when translating between MP3 frames and ADU frames.

2004.01.09:
- Modified "RTSPClient" to handle embedded NULL characters in a SDP
  description.  (These are not legal, but they have been seen in some cases.)

2004.01.06:
- Modified the FramedSource 'after getting' function signature to take two new
  parameters: (1) The number of bytes (if any) that were truncated from the
  delivered data, and (2) The duration (in microseconds) of the delivered frame.
  For backwards compatibility with old code, the old 'after getting' function
  signature is still supported, but will be removed in some future version of
  the code.  (The "getPlayTime()" function was also removed.)

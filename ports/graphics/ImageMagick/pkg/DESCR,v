@ImageMagick is an X11 package for display and interactive manipulation
of images.  The package includes tools for image conversion, annotation,
compositing, animation, and creating montages.  ImageMagick can read and
write many of the more popular image formats (e.g. JPEG, TIFF, PNM, XPM,
Photo CD, etc.).

With ImageMagick you can:

     o load an image from a file
     o display the next image
     o display the former image
     o display a sequence of images as a slide show
     o write the image to a file
     o print the image to a Postscript printer
     o delete the image file
     o create a Visual Image Directory
     o select the image to display by its thumbnail rather than name
     o undo last image transformation
     o copy a region of the image
     o paste a region to the image
     o restore the image to its original size
     o refresh the image
     o half the image size
     o double the image size
     o resize the image
     o crop the image
     o cut the image
     o flop image in the horizontal direction
     o flip image in the vertical direction
     o rotate the image 90 degrees clockwise
     o rotate the image 90 degrees counter-clockwise
     o rotate the image
     o shear the image
     o trim the image edges
     o invert the colors of the image
     o vary the color brightness
     o vary the color saturation
     o vary the image hue
     o gamma correct the image
     o sharpen the image contrast
     o dull the image contrast
     o perform histogram equalization on the image
     o perform histogram normalization on the image
     o negate the image colors
     o toggle the colormap type: : Shared or Private
     o reduce the speckles within an image
     o eliminate peak noise from an image
     o detect edges within the image
     o emboss an image
     o oil paint an image
     o convert the image to grayscale
     o set the maximum number of unique colors in the image
     o segment the image by color
     o apply image processing techniques to a region of interest
     o annotate the image with text
     o draw on the image
     o edit an image pixel color
     o edit the image matte information
     o composite an image with another
     o add a border to the image
     o surround image with an ornamental border
     o add an image comment
     o display image centered on a backdrop
     o display image to background of a window
     o display information about the image
     o display information about this program
     o discard all images and exit program
     o change the level of magnification
     o display images specified by a World Wide Web (WWW) uniform resource
       locator (URL)

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Now we can update MirPorts from OpenBSD ports tree again,
that we have fixed pkg_install tools accordingly in both
stable and current, and that these tools are compatible.

Consider MirPorts locked until next commit of ports/INDEX,v

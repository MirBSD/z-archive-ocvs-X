@* adjustments for new <bsd.lib.mk> of MirOS
  (backwards-compatible)
* libjpeg_pic.a leaves the tarball (even if built on OtherBSD)
* LDADD for libs, not LDFLAGS.
  LDFLAGS is for flags (-static et al.)
  benz, did you even test that?
* bump patchlevel

@libjpeg has been broken since MirLibtool was introduced, noticed while
doing bulk build.

Their build system is really stupid: You cannot recreate 'configure' since
configure.in is missing. This time, I did the Right Thing(TM): replace the
whole autoconf stuff by bsd.lib.mk/bsd.prog.mk.

Bump patchlevel, package contents has changed.

@it's over, people

--
Usually, the BSD community _never_ removes credits (the MirOS COPYRIGHT
file being a pretty good example for that fact). However, the OpenBSD
people required me to remove their names from the MirPorts framework,
where it got imported to from the OpenBSD ports tree, and declared as
contributor of the port to OpenBSD. I can understand their privacy is-
sues, but still am not easy with this decision. However, I have to obey.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1
log
@libjpeg has been broken since MirLibtool was introduced, noticed while
doing bulk build.

Their build system is really stupid: You cannot recreate 'configure' since
configure.in is missing. This time, I did the Right Thing(TM): replace the
whole autoconf stuff by bsd.lib.mk/bsd.prog.mk.

Bump patchlevel, package contents has changed.

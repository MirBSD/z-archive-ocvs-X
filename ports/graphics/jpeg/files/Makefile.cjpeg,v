@* adjustments for new <bsd.lib.mk> of MirOS
  (backwards-compatible)
* libjpeg_pic.a leaves the tarball (even if built on OtherBSD)
* LDADD for libs, not LDFLAGS.
  LDFLAGS is for flags (-static et al.)
  benz, did you even test that?
* bump patchlevel

log
@libjpeg has been broken since MirLibtool was introduced, noticed while
doing bulk build.

Their build system is really stupid: You cannot recreate 'configure' since
configure.in is missing. This time, I did the Right Thing(TM): replace the
whole autoconf stuff by bsd.lib.mk/bsd.prog.mk.

Bump patchlevel, package contents has changed.

@Dia is designed to be much like the commercial Windows program 'Visio'.
It can be used to draw many different kinds of diagrams.  It currently
has special objects to help draw entity relationship diagrams, UML
diagrams, flowcharts, network diagrams, and simple circuits.  It is also
possible to add support for new shapes by writing simple XML files,
using a subset of SVG to draw the shape.  It can load and save diagrams
to a custom XML format (gzipped by default, to save space), can export
diagrams to EPS or SVG formats and can print diagrams (including ones
that span multiple pages).

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Now we can update MirPorts from OpenBSD ports tree again,
that we have fixed pkg_install tools accordingly in both
stable and current, and that these tools are compatible.

Consider MirPorts locked until next commit of ports/INDEX,v

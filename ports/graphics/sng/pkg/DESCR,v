log
@The sng program converts files from the Scriptable Network Graphics
to Portable Network Graphics, or back again. SNG is specifically
designed to be an editable representation of all the data in a PNG.

@SNG (Scriptable Network Graphics) is a textual minilanguage
designed specifically to reflect the data and structure of PNG
(Portable Network Graphics) files in an editable form.
                                                                                                                               
The sng program translates between SNG and PNG. It can be useful
especially for viewing and editing data in obscure ancillary
chanks that graphics editors won't handle. Also, since SNG is
easy to generate from scripts, sng may be useful at the end of a
pipeline that programmatically generates PNG images.

1.1.1.2
log
@Now we can update MirPorts from OpenBSD ports tree again,
that we have fixed pkg_install tools accordingly in both
stable and current, and that these tools are compatible.

Consider MirPorts locked until next commit of ports/INDEX,v

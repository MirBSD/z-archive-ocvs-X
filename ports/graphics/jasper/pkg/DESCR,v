@The JasPer Project is a collaborative effort between Image Power,
Inc.  and the University of British Columbia. The objective of this
project is to develop a software-based reference implementation of
the codec specified in the JPEG-2000 Part-1 standard (i.e., ISO/IEC
15444-1). This software has also been submitted to the ISO for
inclusion in the JPEG-2000 Part-5 standard (as an official reference
implementation).

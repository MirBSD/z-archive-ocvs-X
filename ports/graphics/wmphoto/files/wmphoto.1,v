@.\" $OpenBSD: wmphoto.1,v 1.1.1.1 2001/01/16 22:44:43 naddy Exp $
.Dd Oct 3, 1999
.Dt WMPHOTO 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm wmphoto
.Md show photo
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm wmphoto
.Op Ar add image-file
.Sh Hints for wmphoto

Once you successfully get your first image (as shown later), the
mouse buttons are:
.br
1. exec 1st command for current photo.
.br
2. exec 2nd command for current photo.
.br
3. rescan ~/.wmphoto and get next photo.



.Sh How this works

wmphoto reads pictures and commands from the user directory ~/.wmphoto/.
A so called "profile" is a file having the extension ".xpm.gz".

Yes, this file is a xpm and gzipped picture that wmphoto displays
for you.  This image MUST BE 48-width and 52-height sizes, and no more than
256 colors!

The commands for this photo are saved on a file with the name of
the profile (wihout the .xpm.gz extension).  In this file, the first line
is the 1st command, and the second line is the 2nd command.



.Sh How to add a photo (the hard way)

Ask a friend for a photo of him/her.  Once you have it, use a graphics
program (ex: gimp) for:
.br
1. scale the photo to 48x52.
.br
2. save it as xpm, no more than 256 colors.
.br
3. gzip it

Now copy your photo to the ~/.wmphoto/ directory, for example,
~/.wmphoto/john.xpm.gz.  That's all!  Now run wmphoto and john's picture will
appear.

If you want add more photos, do the same and save it with other name
(let's say ~/.wmphoto/sara.xpm.gz).  Not need to close wmphoto!  Just press
the 3rd Button mouse, and wmphoto will rescan the ~/.wmphoto directory and
show you the next photo.



.Sh How to setup your commands (the hard way)

Now you have both photos, create a file like this:
.br
~/.wmphoto/john
.br
xterm -e pine john@@windowmaker.org
.br
xterm -e talk john@@windowmaker.org

The first line is the command executed whe you click on the john's
picture.  You can do the same for sara's photo.

Note that you must rescan ~/.wmphoto (just press 3rd button until
reappear john's photo) for changes to take effect.



.Sh How to make both things (the easy way, IMHO)

If you have a image named john.jpg (no matter the size, colors or
format), just do:

% wmphoto add /path/to/john.jpg
.br
Wmphoto will ask you a couple of questions now...
you *need* ImageMagick's `convert` program to do this!

Enter a name for this profile: john
.br
Command to run for button1? (ex: xterm -e pine amartoq@@dcc.uchile.cl)
.br
xterm -e pine john@@windowmaker.org
.br
Command to run for button2? (ex: xterm -e talk amartoq@@dcc.uchile.cl)
.br
xterm -e talk john@@windowmaker.org

Creating /your/home/directory/.wmphoto/john... good.
.br
Executing convert, this may take a while...
.br
convert -colors 255 -dither -geometry 48x52! /path/to/john.jpg xpm:/your/home/directory/.wmphoto/john.xpm.gz done.
.br

If you are already running wmphoto, just press the 3rd
button over it until appear your new photo.
To add a new photo, just run wmphoto this same way.

As you see, you need ImageMagick for this to work.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

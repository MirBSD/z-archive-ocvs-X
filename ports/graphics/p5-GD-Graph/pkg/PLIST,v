1.2
log
@big cleanup action:
* remove remaining lots of traces of modgcc3
  (finally!)
* remove man3p and cat3p occurrences
  (mostly scripted)
* regenerate INDEX for the record and tarballs
  (makes 2834, not much of a difference)

This MirPorts-current seems "stable enough", although still a lot
doesn't run (but, I think, again fewer than ever before), and several
ports need testing, but we'll release this with MirOS #7quater.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Now we can update MirPorts from OpenBSD ports tree again,
that we have fixed pkg_install tools accordingly in both
stable and current, and that these tools are compatible.

Consider MirPorts locked until next commit of ports/INDEX,v

.Sh NAME
.Nm jenscript
.Nd convert japanese text to PostScript
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm jenscript
.Op Fl EGMdknstx
.Op Ar -columns
.Op Fl F Ar afont
.Op Fl L Ar lines
.Op Fl P Ar printpage
.Op Fl S Ar fontsize
.Op Fl b Ar header
.Op Fl f Ar kfont
.Op Fl l Ar language
.Ar files ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
prints 
.Ar files
as a PostScript file. The result will hold japanese font names,
and may need post-processing through
.Xr kanjips 1 
to be printed.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl E
Assume EUC encoding for the input files, 
instead of the default JIS/SJIS encodings.
Note that
.Nm
does not handle automatic encoding recognition. You should use
a tool such as
.Xr nkf 1
for that.
.It Fl G
Display a banner on top of each page.
.It Fl M
Set manual feed.
.It Fl d
Debug mode.
.It Fl k
Encode character data as octal, for transmission on 7-bit lines.
.It Fl n
Suppress PS-Adobe-2.0 in header.
.It Fl s
Use A4 paper size instead of the default US letter size.
.It Fl t
Turn paper to Landscape orientation.
.It Fl x
Use fixed width fonts for roman characters.
This replaces Times-Roman, Times-Bold, and Times-Italic with Courier,
Courier-Bold and Courier-Oblique.
.It Ar -columns
Output
.Ar columns 
columns on each page. By default, 
.Nm
outputs one single column.
.It Fl F Ar afont
Use  the single PostScript font
.Ar afont
instead of the default roman fonts. 
.It Fl L Ar lines
Output 
.Ar lines
lines in each column. By default, the number of lines is computed
from the font size.
.It Fl P Ar printpage
Start printing from page 
.Ar printpage .
.It Fl S Ar fontsize
Use 
.Ar fontsize
as the roman character font size. By default, 6 points.
.It Fl b Ar header
Print 
.Ar header
in the header line instead of the current file name. 
This only makes sense if
.Fl g
is also used.
.It Fl f Ar kfont
Use
.Ar kfont
as a japanese kanji font.  
.It Fl l Ar language
Format text according to 
.Xr vgrind 1
specs for 
.Ar language
.El
.Pp
The choice of japanese font and japanese font sizes are normally 
automatic from the roman font size. Sizes of 6 points, 8 points and 12
points correspond to the jis24, jis32 and jis48 fonts, respectively.
Since those are bitmap fonts, using other sizes will only affect the
roman characters sizes.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -compact -width /usr/local/share/kanjips_fonts
.It Pa /usr/local/share/kanjips_fonts
Where the jis24, jis32, jis48 fonts are used.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

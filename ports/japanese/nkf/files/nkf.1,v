.Sh NAME
.Nm nkf 
.Nd Network Kanji code conversion Filter v1.6.2
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm nkf
.Op Fl blrtTuvxXZ 
.Op Fl ejs
.Op Fl BEJS
.Op Fl m Op Ar BQ
.Op Fl f Ar n
.Op Fl io Ar c
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Nkf
is yet another kanji encoding converter between networks, hosts and terminals.
It converts any input kanji encoding to a designated kanji encoding,
such as 7-bit JIS, MS-kanji (shifted-JIS) or EUC.
.Pp
One of the most unique features of
.Nm nkf
is the guess of the input kanji encoding.
It currently recognizes 7-bit JIS, MS-kanji (shifted-JIS) and EUC
automatically, so users don't need to know the kanji encoding used for input.

By default X0201 kana is converted into X0208 kana. For
X0201 kana, SO/SI, SSO and
ESC-(-I methods are supported. For automatic encoding detection, 
.Nm nkf 
assumes no X0201 kana in MS-Kanji. To accept X0201 in MS-Kanji, use 
.Fl X , 
.Fl x 
or
.Fl S .
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl b
buffered output (default).
.It Fl u
unbuffered output.
.It Fl t
no operation.
.It Fl j
output 7-bit JIS code (default).
.It Fl s
output MS-kanji (shifted-JIS) code.
.It Fl e
output EUC (AT&T) code.
.It Fl i Ar c
output an
ESC $ 
.Ar c
sequence to designate JIS-kanji
(Default is B).
.It Fl o Ar c
output an
ESC ( 
.Ar c
sequence to designate single-byte roman characters
(Default is B).
.It Fl r
{de/en}crypt ROT13/47.
.It Fl v
display Version.
.It Fl T
Text mode output (MS-DOS).
.It Fl m
MIME ISO-2022-JP/ISO8859-1 decoding. To see ISO8859-1 (Latin-1) 
.Fl l 
is necessary.
.It Fl m Ar B
Decode MIME base64 encoded stream. Remove header or other parts before
conversion.
.It Fl m Ar Q
Decode MIME quoted stream. '_' inside quotes is converted to space.
.It Fl l
Input and output code is ISO8859-1 (Latin-1) and ISO-2022-JP.
.Fl s , 
.Fl e and 
.Fl x 
are not compatible with this option.
.It Fl f Ar n
Folding on length 
.Ar n 
in a line (default 60).
.It Fl X
Allow X0201 kana in MS-Kanji.  
X0201 is converted into X0208 by default.
.It Fl x
Try to preseve X0208 kana.
Assume X0201 kana in MS-Kanji. And
do not convert X0201 kana to X0208. 
In JIS output, ESC-(-I is used. In EUC output, SSO is used.
.It Fl Z
Convert X0208 alphabet to ASCII.
.It Fl S
Assume MS-Kanji and X0201 kana input. It also accepts JIS.
AT&T EUC is recognized as X0201 kana. Without the 
.Fl x
flag, X0201 kana is converted into X0208.
.It Fl J
Assume  JIS input. It also accepts Japanese EUC.
This is the default. This flag does not exclude MS-Kanji.
.It Fl E
Assume AT&T EUC input. It also accept JIS.
Same as 
.Fl J ,
present for symetry.
.It Fl B
Assume broken JIS-Kanji, where ESC has been lost.  Useful when your site is 
using old B-News Nihongo patch.

for a comprehensive description of japanese text encoding systems.
.Sh BUGS
.Nm Nkf
cannot handle some inputs that contain mixed kanji encoding.
.Pp
Automatic code detection 
becomes very weak with \-x, \-X and \-S.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@* remove Waldemar Brodkorb as Maintainer as per his request
* merge MirXAWTV and OpenXAWTV
* merge import of the following ports:
  - databases/openldap
  - mail/mutt
  - mail/p5-Mail-SpamAssassin
  - net/irssi
  - www/snownews
* also, apply fixes so that irssi "might" build again
  (work by myself, even if I despise irssi totally)
* merge that another import again
* add back uvscan, uvscan_dat (XXX needs update!)
* remove calls to "sysctl -w kern.emul.foo=1" in PLISTs!
  no port is allowed to do such a change to the system!
* various minor fixes of rough edges which make more ports compile
* cosmetics in databases/db: no need to have four files,
  DESCR${SUBPACKAGE}, with identical contents

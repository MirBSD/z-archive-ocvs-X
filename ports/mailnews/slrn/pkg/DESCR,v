@slrn (``s-lang read news'') is a newsreader, i.e. a program that
accesses a newsserver to read messages from the Internet News service
(also known as ``Usenet''). It runs in console mode on various
Unix-like systems (including Linux), 32-bit Windows, OS/2, BeOS and
VMS.

Beside the usual features of a newsreader, slrn supports scoring
rules to highlight, sort or kill articles based on information from
their header. It is highly customizable, allows free key-bindings
and can easily be extended using the sophisticated s-lang macro
language. Offline reading is possible by using either slrnpull
(shipped with slrn) or a local newsserver (like leafnode or INN).

@The  Solid POP3 Server is an implementation of a Post Office
Protocol version 3 server that has flexibility as  its  main
goal.  The server is easily configurable and has support for
few features such as:

 o APOP authentication scheme
 o Virtual hosting
 o Maildir and mailbox handling
 o Bulletins
 o Expiration of messages

Each user can specify his maildrop (its position and  type).
The  format  used  in  specification  of maildrop's position
should handle almost all widely-used system  configurations.
The server also seems to be fast, however no tests have been
performed, so it's rather relative feeling.  The design used
is  very  similar  to  the design of Solar Designer's POPA3D
server. This solution let's minimalize size of code  working
with  root privileges. The code was also heavily checked for
buffer overflow leaks and file races. None have  been  found
as for now. All operations on files are done with user priv-
ileges. There is no SUID APOP  secrets  database  management
program  (as  in  QPOP). Each user can specify his secret in
his own home directory.

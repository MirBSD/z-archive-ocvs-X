@SECURITY: Update exim to 4.44. Fixes: CAN-2005-0021, CAN-2005-0022,
OPSA_20050205-1.

While here, replace INSTALL/DEINSTALL by @@sample. You *must* do a "make
setup" before you install this port.

@+---------------
| It is strongly advised that you configure exim to use
| a UID and GID other that 0/0. You can do this by adding
| lines to the configure file like this:
| 
|       exim_user = "_exim"
|       exim_group = "_exim"
|       with uid/gid = "521"
| 
| but you must remember to allow that user write
| permissions to /var/spool/exim.
| 
| If you want to do local deliveries as another user
| (e.g. if you allow users to put procmail into their
| .forward file) make the exim binary setuid root.
| 
| If you intend replacing sendmail with exim, then don't
| forget to modify /etc/mailer.conf accordingly; see
| mailwrapper(8).

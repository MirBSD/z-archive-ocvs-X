@Mail::Audit itself isn't a mail filter - it's a toolkit that makes
it very easy for you to build mail filters. You write a program
that describes what should happen to your mail, and this replaces
your procmail command in your .forward or .qmail file.

Mail::Audit provides the functionality for extracting mail headers,
bouncing, accepting, rejecting, forwarding, and filtering incoming
mail.

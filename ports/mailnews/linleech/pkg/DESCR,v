@linleech is a utility that will search through all the articles in given 
USENET groups and download those that meet your configured criteria.
Via the use of S-Lang, a very granular control over what is downloaded is
achieved; It can perform regexp matching on articles to fetch only those
that you are interested in, alleviating you of the need to browse through
a plethora of uninteresting articles.

Another useful feature is the ability to perform arbitrary commands on each
article as it is downloaded, such as uudecoding and moving it to an archive.

@XFMail is X11 application for receiving electronic mail. It was created
using XForms library toolkit by T.C. Zhao and Mark Overmars.

It's partially compatible with MH style mail- boxes but it does not
require any mh tools to be installed on the system. You can read most of
your MH folders and messages with XFMail.

XFMail has very friendly user interface and it's extremely easy in use. It
implements most of the mail functionality in one program and it does
not require any additional tools.

It makes use of the faces libraries, showing the faces when available.

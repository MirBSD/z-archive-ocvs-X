@Teapop is an RFC1939 and RFC2449 compliant POP3-server, which is quickly 
gaining world-wide recognition. With its' flexible virtual domain support, 
Teapop distinguishes itself from other POP3-servers. The possibility to 
authenticate users in several different ways, for example 
PostgreSQL-databases and Apache htpasswd files, lets Teapop adapt itself 
to Your	setup, rather than the other way around as with traditional 
POP3-servers.

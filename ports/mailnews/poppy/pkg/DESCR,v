@Poppy is a small perl script that allows you to perform simple tasks
on a POP3 or IMAP server.  It is of most use in a "limited resources
environment" whether thats low disk space, slow internet connection,
or no graphical environment.

Poppy will individually show the mail headers along with the message's
size of each message on the mail server and then allow you to read,
delete, reply, or perform other tasks on that message.

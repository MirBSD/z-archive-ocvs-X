@Hypermail is a program that takes a file of mail messages in UNIX mailbox
format and generates a set of cross-referenced HTML documents. 
Each file that is created represents a separate message in the mail
archive and contains links to other articles, so that the entire archive
can be browsed in a number of ways by following links.
Archives generated by Hypermail can be incrementally updated, and Hypermail
is set by default to only update archives when changes are detected.

@This is GNU Mailman, a mailing list management system distributed
under the GNU Public License (GPL).

Mailman has most of the standard features you'd expect in a
mailing list manager, and more:

- Web based list administration for nearly all tasks.  Web based
  subscriptions and user configuration management.  A customizable
  "home page" for each mailing list.

- Privacy features such as moderation, open and closed list
  subscription policies, and private membership rosters.

- Automatic web based archiving built-in with support for private
  and public archives, and hooks for external archivers.

- Per-user configuration optional digest delivery for either
  MIME-compliant or RFC 934 style "plain text" digests.

- Integrated mail/Usenet gateways.

- Integrated auto-replies.

- Majordomo-style email based commands.

- Integrated bounce detection within an extensible framework.

- Integrated spam detection.

- An extensible mail delivery pipeline.

- Support for virtual domains.

Flavors:

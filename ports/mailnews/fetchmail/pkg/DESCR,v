@fetchmail is a free, full-featured, robust, well-documented remote
mail retrieval and forwarding utility intended to be used over
on-demand TCP/IP links (such as SLIP or PPP connections).  It
retrieves mail from remote mail servers and forwards it to your local
(client) machine's delivery system, so it can then be read by
normal mail user agents such as elm(1) or Mail(1).

fetchmail supports standard all mail-retrieval protocols in use on the
Internet: POP2, POP3 (including POP3 with RFC1938 one-time passwords),
RPOP, APOP, KPOP, Compuserve's POP3 with RPA, Microsoft's NTLM, Demon
Internet's SDPS, all flavors of IMAP (including IMAP4rev1 with RFC1731
Kerberos v4 or GSSAPI authentication or CRAM-MD5 authentication), and
ESMTP ETRN.  Fetchmail also supports end-to-end encryption with OpenSSL.

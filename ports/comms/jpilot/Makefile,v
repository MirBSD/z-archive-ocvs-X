@* do an espie and convert all MODULES= to new-style
* while here, sanitise subdir handling and flesh out
  all the flavoured subdirectory calls in the parent
  level Makefile into the directory itself for being
  easier adoptable
  (intermediate commit, I need to clean up the fall-
  out afterwards)
* prepare for great unification of subdir-mks

@it's over, people

Usually, the BSD community _never_ removes credits (the MirOS COPYRIGHT
file being a pretty good example for that fact). However, the OpenBSD
people required me to remove their names from the MirPorts framework,
where it got imported to from the OpenBSD ports tree, and declared as
contributor of the port to OpenBSD. I can understand their privacy is-
sues, but still am not easy with this decision. However, I have to obey.

@Disable build of a pilot-link test program during configure; the test
program bails out, but jpilot itself works fine. Sigh.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

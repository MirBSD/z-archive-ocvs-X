@wmcalc is a program designed to act as a simple four-function
calculator.  It is different from other calculator programs, however
in that it is designed to take up very little desktop space.  As
such, it can be left running on the desktop at all times.

It is intended to placed in the Window Maker dock, or in Wharf under
Afterstep, though it should run as well under any window manager.

You need a ~/.wmcalc file, copy a sample from ${SAMPLE_DIR}.

wmcalc -h gives you usage info.

Buttons are defined as:
 ____________________
|       x99          | 	where: x = 1 for Left Mouse Button   
| 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9|         x = 2 for Middle Mouse Button
|--------------------|	       x = 3 for Right Mouse Button
|x11 x07 x08 x09 x51 |                
|x12 x04 x05 x06 x52 |	Note: the numbers 0..9 are the
|x13 x01 x02 x03 x53 |        indicators for memory cells
|x14 x00 x34 x44 x54 |        0..9 respectively.
 --------------------

Button Functions:
199	Reinitialize the calculator, and both Registers
        (Clear All).
299	Clear all the memory registers (0..10).
399     Clear the current number being entered only.
x13	Start a program defined by CalcStart variable in
        config file.
1yy	Perform function shown on button.
2yy	Recall number from memory location [0-9] to display
	for calculation,
		if yy = 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.
3yy	Store Displayed number in memory location [0-9],
		if yy = 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.
1zz	Hopefully the other functions are obvious from
        their button graphics.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Now we can update MirPorts from OpenBSD ports tree again,
that we have fixed pkg_install tools accordingly in both
stable and current, and that these tools are compatible.

Consider MirPorts locked until next commit of ports/INDEX,v

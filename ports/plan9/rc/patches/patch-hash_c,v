@Don't use fake getenv() for readline (no, don't ask).

Unbreaks static build on #7-stable, at least with manual Makefile patching
to use readline. I will have to find a proper solution for this, but this
will be needed anyway.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

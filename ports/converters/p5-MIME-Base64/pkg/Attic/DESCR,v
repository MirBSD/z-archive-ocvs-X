@merge CVS; fix here and there a bit

text
@This package contains a Base64 encoder/decoder and a quoted-printable
encoder/decoder.  These encoding methods are specified in RFC 2045 -
MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions).

The Base64 encoding is designed to represent arbitrary sequences of
octets in a form that need not be humanly readable. A 65-character
subset ([A-Za-z0-9+/=]) of US-ASCII is used, enabling 6 bits to be
represented per printable character.

The quoted-printable encoding is intended to represent data that
largely consists of bytes that correspond to printable characters in
the ASCII character set.  Non-printable characters are represented by
a triplet consisting of the character "=" followed by two hexadecimal
digits.

The MIME::Base64 and MIME::QuotedPrint modules used to be part of
libwww-perl package.  They are now distributed separately (this
package).  The main improvement is that the Base64 encoder/decoder is
implemented by XS functions.  This makes it about 20 times faster than
the old implementation in perl.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Initial revision of ESP Ghostscript, replaces cups-pstoraster.

ESP Ghostscript is a version of GPL Ghostscript with added fluff etc. (too
lazy to write the whole blurb)
@
text
@ESP Ghostscript is a PostScript interpreter. It is a derivative of GPL
Ghostscript and contains bug-fixes, an improved build system, CUPS
support and other new stuff.

Flavors:

no_x11		Don't build X11 support
cups		Add CUPS pstoraster driver, needed to print on non-
		PostScript printers (replaces cups-pstoraster)

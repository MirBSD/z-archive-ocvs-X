@o Move job of ${MAINTAINER} to ${RESPONSIBLE} for MirPorts
o Display ${MNTNER}, not ${MAINTAINER} in make describe and friends
o Put the MirBSD licence template on top of MirPorts, because there
  is no such thing as "public domain" in central Europe anyways
o Make even clearer that this is not the OpenBSD ports tree
  (requested by Damien Couderc and co.)
o Move in a quick some ports that we maintain to ${RESPONSIBLE}
  (cleanup will follow on November 1st, 2003)
o regenerate INDEX with the new information from ${MNTNER}

Attention: MirPorts except unified and context diffs, but including
forward (ed) diffs, is now BSD-style licensed. Contextual diffs continue
to share the licence of the file they patch.

@Bring GNU Ghostscript up to shape:

 * Make port honor ${CC}. The brain-dead build system assumes that
   gcc exists and is out default compiler. Sigh.
 * Split off fonts from the main package.
 * Nuke "WWW: $HOMEPAGE".

@This is the GNU GPL'd version of Ghostscript.

Ghostscript is the well-known PostScript interpreter which is available for
all common and most esoteric platforms and supports many different printers
and some displays.

This port includes useful add-ons:
	o Support for HP DeskJet 670, 690, 850, 855, 870, 890, 1100 and 1600,
	  see announcement on
		 http://www.erdw.ethz.ch/~bonk/hp850/hp850.html
	o A Separate package with support for pdf encryption, 
	  see description on
	  	http://www.ozemail.com.au/~geoffk/pdfencrypt/
		
Thomas Merz has written a Ghostscript manual in PDF format:
	http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/merz.html

The manual is also available in German language, see:

@Bring GNU Ghostscript up to shape:

 * Make port honor ${CC}. The brain-dead build system assumes that
   gcc exists and is out default compiler. Sigh.
 * Split off fonts from the main package.
 * Nuke "WWW: $HOMEPAGE".

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Now we can update MirPorts from OpenBSD ports tree again,
that we have fixed pkg_install tools accordingly in both
stable and current, and that these tools are compatible.

Consider MirPorts locked until next commit of ports/INDEX,v

log
@Fix build of gv. Program authors: Please don't name your header files like
well-known system headers and then use both "signal.h" and <signal.h>. As
MirPorts uses -I. in CFLAGS, this breaks.

Make it use .etc/gv for preferences. Remove espie's home-brewed "fixincludes"
script, use the supplied one instead.

Take over responsibility.

@Now we can update MirPorts from OpenBSD ports tree again,
that we have fixed pkg_install tools accordingly in both
stable and current, and that these tools are compatible.

Consider MirPorts locked until next commit of ports/INDEX,v

1.1
log
@Fix build of gv. Program authors: Please don't name your header files like
well-known system headers and then use both "signal.h" and <signal.h>. As
MirPorts uses -I. in CFLAGS, this breaks.

Make it use .etc/gv for preferences. Remove espie's home-brewed "fixincludes"
script, use the supplied one instead.

Take over responsibility.

1.1.1.1
log
@First steps towards a gimp-print port.

Broken:	ghostscript does not come with the IJS tools, and
	I'm not the maintainer of the port where it needs
	to be fixed (maybe just use autoconf for gs?).

Broken:	I'm not going to build and install CUPS in order
	to test this.

Broken:	Neither does the GIMP variant (FLAVOUR gimp1) work,
	because gimp currently segfaults.

Broken:	The GIMP2 variant (FLAVOUR gimp2) won't even start
	to work, because there is no gimp-2.0 port.

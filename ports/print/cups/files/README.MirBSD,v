log
@Update CUPS from rc6 to final. Add a README with details about using a
parallel printer.
@
text
@If you use a parallel printer with CUPS and you experience very slow
printing, try changing the printer's device file to /dev/lpa0 instead
of lpt0. This device uses polling instead of hardware interrupts.

To do so, stop CUPS and edit the file /etc/cups/printers.conf as root.
Change the line

	DeviceURI parallel:/dev/lpt0

to

	DeviceURI parallel:/dev/lpa0

and restart CUPS.

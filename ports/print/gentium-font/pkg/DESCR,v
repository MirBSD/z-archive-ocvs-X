@Gentium is a typeface family designed to enable the diverse ethnic
groups around the world who use the Latin script to produce readable,
high-quality publications. It supports a wide range of Latin-based
alphabets and includes glyphs that correspond to all the Latin ranges
of Unicode.

The design is intended to be highly readable, reasonably compact, and
visually attractive. The additional 'Extended' Latin letters are
designed to naturally harmonize with the traditional 26 ones.
Diacritics are treated with careful thought and attention to their use.
Gentium also supports both ancient and modern Greek, including a number
of alternate forms.
These fonts were originally the product of two years of research and
study by the designer at the University of Reading, England, as part of
an MA program in Typeface Design.

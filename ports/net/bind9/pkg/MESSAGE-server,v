log
@Update and fix bind9.

We have a new distfile with version 9.2.3 now. The needed /var/named
directory is automagically created during package installation.

@+---------------
| To have BIND automatically start at system startup, insert the fragment
| from PREFIX/share/examples/bind9/rc.local.frag into /etc/rc.local and
| add the following line to /etc/rc.conf.local:
| 
| 	syslogd_flags="-a /var/named/dev/log"

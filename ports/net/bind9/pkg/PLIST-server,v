@Frobnicate bind9 further...

The install script now actually works. The manpage for nslookup(8) was
installed under man/man1, this was fixed. Hmm, I wonder if we should
feed back this fix to OpenBSD. Fix some mistakes in the PLIST files,
bump patchlevel.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

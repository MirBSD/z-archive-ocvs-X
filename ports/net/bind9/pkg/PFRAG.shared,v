@Bring BIND 9 port to shape:

* Change maintainer to me since the port is no longer maintained in OpenBSD
* Use OpenBSD's sources (distfile is a CVS checkout of src/usr.bin/bind)
* Remove obsolete patches
* Version is now 9.2.2-P3 with the "delegation-only" patch

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Quagga is a routing software suite, providing implementations of OSPFv2,
OSPFv3, RIP v1 and v2, RIPv3 and BGPv4 for Unix platforms, particularly

GNU Zebra which was developed by Kunihiro Ishiguro. The Quagga tree aims
to build a more involved community around Quagga than the current
centralized model of GNU Zebra.

@/*      This definition allows for colour icon on the desktop
	when mounting a netatalk volume. What Apple 
	Computer Inc. did to achieve colour Volume Icons
	is to place a hidden file in the root of the Volume.
	Within this file are our Icon resources. We have
	icl4, icl8, ICN#, ICS#, ics4, ics8. The resource ID's
	are -16455 for all resources.

	Unforunately Apple made our life a lot harder in that
	the file is called Icon^M. Yes it has an unprintable
	character. We'll try and get around that by specifing
	Icon\015 for the filename. i.mcwilliam@@uws.edu.au */

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Freenet6 is a free IPv6 access service offered by Hexago. This service
enables thousands of people from all over the world to experience the
best solution for a smooth and incremental deployment of IPv6.

Instead of a Web interface, which is usually offered by traditional
tunnel brokers, Freenet6 uses an innovative model based on the TSP
Client. The TSP Client is software that usually runs on a PC and that
implements the Tunnel Setup Protocol (TSP). The TSP Client is used to
automatically negotiate a configured tunnel between a PC or router and
the Freenet6 tunnel broker, making IPv6 easy to install and maintain.
The TSP Client source code is licensed under the GPL. A commercial
license is also available.

Freenet6's TSP is a new initiative launched by Viagenie, a private company
in Canada involved in IPv6 since 1996, to facilitate a faster deployment of
an IPv6 Internet. The Internet is deployed worldwide over IPv4 so this
project's goal is large scale deployment of IPv6 by using configured
tunnels.

Instead of a web interface to request configured tunnels and IPv6 addresses,
Freenet6's TSP is a new model based on a client/server approach. A protocol
is used to request a single IPv6 address to a full IPv6 prefix from a client
to a tunnel server according to the IPv6 broker model. The protocol could be
integrated directly into the operating system to provide a service like DHCP
but for requesting IPv6 addresses or prefixes over an IPv4 network.

but for requesting IPv6 addresses or prefixes over an IPv4 network
(Internet).

This is a modified client (unofficial version) which includes scripts that
have been heavily modified to work and be stylistic ok (at the moment,
OpenBSD and GNU/Linux); the OpenBSD port has also been done by the
maintainer. Furthermore two HOWTOs are included (English and German ones).

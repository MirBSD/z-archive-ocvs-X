Quick notes on security issues using BIND 8
-------------------------------------------

The base version of BIND from ISC is 8.2.5, which is belived
to be fairly secure (i.e no obvious or (to the author) known bugs).
It is, however, a large and complex piece of software, so there are 
bound to be bugs found in the future...

On OpenBSD, the recommended configuration is to run named in a 
chroot()-ed jail, typically /var/named, and also running named as
non-root, this currently defaults to user 'named'.  

The main configuration file /var/named/named.conf should be owned
by 'root', group 'named' and set to mode 640.
The user 'named' must be able to _read_ the file (reloading the 
nameserver, etc) but 'named' should never be able to _write_ into 
the file.

From this follows that the /var/named directory should not be writable 
by user 'named'. In fact, the directories that require writes by user
'named' are all the zone directories and /var/named/var/run. 
All other directories should be owned by 'root', group 'wheel'.
The /var/named/var/tmp directory should be mode 1777 (sticky bit set).

If you are using signed zones, don't store your private zone key(s) 
under /var/named.

Some additional work has been done to the source for this port/snapshot, 
this currently includes: 

	** Don't allow source routed sockets 
	** Most sprintf() have been changed to snprintf() 
	** Likewise strcpy() & strncpy() to strlcpy() in 
	   binaries named and named-xfer 
	** use mkstemp() instead of mktemp() 
	** Generate good random query IDs

There are also some functionality/bugfix patches (from the indicated sources).
[These are not strictly security related, but this seems a good place
 to mention this anyway, so...]

	** global transfer-source option [ISC]
	** allow trusted keys to be specified in hex [TISlabs]
        ** support multiple CNAMEs [ISC]

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Update gaim to 1.1.2, all patches from OpenBSD.

SILC support was disabled because devel/silc-toolkit is broken.

@Gaim is a GTK+-based multi-protocol instant messaging client. It
is compatible with AIM, ICQ, MSN Messenger, Yahoo, IRC, Jabber,
Gadu-Gadu, Novell GroupWise, and Zephyr networks.

Gaim supports many features of the various networks, such as file
transfer, away messages, typing notification, and MSN window closing
notification. It also goes beyond that and provides many unique
features. A few popular features are Buddy Pounces, which give the
ability to notify you, send a message, play a sound, or run a program
when a specific buddy goes away, signs online, or returns from idle;
and plugins, consisting of text replacement, a buddy ticker, extended
message notification, iconify on away, and more.

Gaim integrates well with GNOME and KDE's system trays.  This allows
you to work with Gaim without requiring the buddy list window to
be up at all times.

Gaim is under constant development, and releases are usually frequent.

GAIM is a GTK+-based AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) application using
the tik/toc service from AOL.  It is actively being developed and
supports many common AOL features and should have an interface
familiar to anyone who has used AOL's AIM client before.  It also
has multiple protocol support for such things as ICQ, IRC, Yahoo!,
MSN Messenger, Jabber, and Napster.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

Gaim is a GTK+-based multi-protocol instant messaging client. It is
compatible with AIM (Oscar and TOC protocols), ICQ, MSN Messenger,
Yahoo, IRC, Jabber, Gadu-Gadu, and Zephyr networks.

Gaim supports many features of the various networks, such as file
transfer (coming soon), away messages, typing notification, and MSN
window closing notification. It also goes beyond that and provides many
unique features. A few popular features are Buddy Pounces, which give
the ability to notify you, send a message, play a sound, or run a
program when a specific buddy goes away, signs online, or returns from
idle; and plugins, consisting of text replacement, a buddy ticker,
extended message notification, iconify on away, and more.

Gaim integrates well with GNOME 2 and KDE 3.1's system trays.  This
allows you to work with gaim without requiring the buddy list window to
be up at all times.

Gaim is under constant development, and releases are usually frequent.

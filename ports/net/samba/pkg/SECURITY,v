@compile the smbd main function without ProPolice
XXX is this an smbd or an SSP bug?

@$MirBSD$

* smbd/server.c must be compiled without ProPolice SSP, thus
  leaving the Server Message Block daemon wide open for a
  buffer overflow attack.

  The smb daemon errored out in function open_sockets_smbd
  but I cannot find the itch to scratch in order to fix it.
  It may be a SSP malfunction, it may be a real bug in smbd;
  I don't know.

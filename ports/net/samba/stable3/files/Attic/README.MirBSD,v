Using samba package in MirBSD environment:

1. Copy /usr/local/lib/samba/smb.conf.sample to /etc/samba/smb.conf and edit
   it.

2. Edit /etc/rc.conf.local:
   ...
   smbd_flags="-D"         # for normal use: "-D"
   nmbd_flags="-D"         # for normal use: "-D"
   ...

3. Edit /etc/rc.local:
   echo -n 'starting local daemons:'
   ...
   if [ -f /etc/samba/smb.conf ]; then
       if [ X"${smbd_flags}" != X"NO" -a -x /usr/local/libexec/smbd ]; then
           echo -n ' smbd';    /usr/local/libexec/smbd ${smbd_flags}
       fi
       if [ X"${nmbd_flags}" != X"NO" -a -x /usr/local/libexec/nmbd ]; then
           echo -n ' nmbd';    /usr/local/libexec/nmbd ${nmbd_flags}
       fi
   fi
   ...
   echo '.'

Steps 4 and 5 are only necessary if you want to enable swat (Samba 
Web Administration Tool). Please note that administering the server
with swat over a network is inadvisable as passwords are passed in
the clear. You can avoid this problem by using ssh forwarding to
port 901.

4. add the following entry to /etc/inetd.conf:

   ...
   swat  stream  tcp  nowait.400  root  /usr/local/libexec/swat  swat
   ...

5. add the following entry to /etc/services:

   ...
   swat            901/tcp                 # samba admin service
   ...

See documentation files in /usr/local/share/doc/samba and example config
files in /usr/local/share/examples/samba for more information.

@Sorry wbx, but there is absolutely no point in having net/samba3
when net/samba is already subdir'd.

Plus, you cloned even the same lame typo in the INSTALL script
you stole from an OpenBSD port, but removed their RCS Id. This
is what is called plagiarism, and there is one BSD project al-
ready which has fallen for this trap.

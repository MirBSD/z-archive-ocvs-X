@MLdonkey is a peer-to-peer filesharing client for several popular p2p
networks.  It supports eDonkey, Overnet, Fasttrack (Kazaa), Gnutella,
BitTorrent and others.  The program can be controlled using a telnet,
X11, or Web frontend.

@Bring MLdonkey port to shape:

 * Update to 2.5-4, which seems to fix important bugs (?)
 * Correct LIB_DEPENDS (gtk+)
 * Clean up the really messy Makefile
 * Update checksums and PLIST
 * Better description, nuke WWW
 * Take over responsibility for MirBSD

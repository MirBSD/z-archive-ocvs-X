@Initial revision

@This is the SuSE Proxy-Suite, a set of programs to enhance firewall
security. The first (and currently only) component being released is the
FTP-Proxy.

FTP-Proxy
---------

- Securely relays FTP connections between clients and servers 
- Can switch connections from active to passive and vice versa 
- Utilizes port ranges for both control and data connections 
- Provides extensive auditing (via syslog or rotating log files) 
- Can separate user related from system triggered audit events 
- Provides command restriction based on logged in user name 
- Allows command argument checking with regular expressions (*)
- Is able to retrieve configuration data from an LDAP directory (*)
- Has been thoroughly tested against buffer overflow attacks 
- Fully conforms to RFC 959 and 1123 (the basic FTP RFCs) 
- Planned to support RFC 1579 ("Firewall Friendly FTP") 
- Planned to support RFC 2428 (IPv6 Extensions for FTP) 
- Based on GNU AutoConf, supposed to run on many UNIX systems

(*) Not in this OpenBSD port.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Now we can update MirPorts from OpenBSD ports tree again,
that we have fixed pkg_install tools accordingly in both
stable and current, and that these tools are compatible.

Consider MirPorts locked until next commit of ports/INDEX,v

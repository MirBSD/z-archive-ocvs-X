1.2
log
@big cleanup action:
* remove remaining lots of traces of modgcc3
  (finally!)
* remove man3p and cat3p occurrences
  (mostly scripted)
* regenerate INDEX for the record and tarballs
  (makes 2834, not much of a difference)

This MirPorts-current seems "stable enough", although still a lot
doesn't run (but, I think, again fewer than ever before), and several
ports need testing, but we'll release this with MirOS #7quater.

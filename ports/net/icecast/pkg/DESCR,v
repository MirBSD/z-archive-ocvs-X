@SECURITY: Update to icecast-2.2.0, solves an absolutely ridiculous issue.

It is possible to execute remote code simply using HTTP request plus
31 headers followed by a shellcode that will be executed directly.

While here, also update distinfo, use MirLibtool. All patches and PLIST
from OpenBSD.

@Icecast is a streaming media server which currently supports Ogg
Vorbis and MP3 audio streams. It can be used to create an Internet
radio station or a privately running jukebox and many things in
between. It is very versatile in that new formats can be added
relatively easily and supports open standards for communication and
interaction.

Icecast v2 is a complete rewrite of the old Icecast streaming server.
It was designed to be highly efficient and have low memory requirements.

Additional features are, among others:

   * a web-based administration interface including simple file serving
     (disabled by default on OpenBSD) - seeking in such served files is
     possible
   * supports listing in stream directories
   * new relay system
   * listener authentication
   * multi-level fallbacks
   * "burst-on-connect" to significantly reduce buffering latency on the
     client side
   * Shoutcast-style client support (allows use of Shoutcast DSP and
     NSV support using their native tools)

Security features include chroot()ing and dropping privileges, if
configured to do so.

Icecast is an Internet based broadcasting system based on the Mpeg Layer III
streaming technology. It is, however, not limited to streaming mp3 files.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Now we can update MirPorts from OpenBSD ports tree again,
that we have fixed pkg_install tools accordingly in both
stable and current, and that these tools are compatible.

Consider MirPorts locked until next commit of ports/INDEX,v

After many years of development, testing and even production use,
Icecast v2 is also very stable.

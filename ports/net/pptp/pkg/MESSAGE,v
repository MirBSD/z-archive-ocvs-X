@Documentation has been installed in ${PREFIX}/share/doc/pptp/.

english FAQ:
http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq6.html#PPTP

A reconnect-script has been installed as ${PREFIX}/sbin/pptp-reconnect,
edit it to reflect your environment.

Next, setup /etc/ppp/{options,chap-secrets,pap-secrets} with
information provided by your ISP.

If you get "LCP timeout sending config request" messages, build a
kernel without "GRE encapsulation interface" support.
(NB: look in /usr/src/sys/conf/GENERIC for "pseudo-device   gre     1".)


See http://www.counterpane.com/pptp-faq.html for a list of security flaws.
==========================================================================
ATTENTION:
Alcatel ADSL modems contain default logins with easily computed passwords.
See http://security.sdsc.edu/self-help/alcatel/ for more information.
==========================================================================
You may want to use TCP/IP packet filter rules to prevent unauthorized 
access to your modem (from internal net or spoofed/bounced TCP/IP packets).

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

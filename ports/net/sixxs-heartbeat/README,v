The SixXS heartbeat client is obsolete: there is an AICCU/AYIYA (wtf?)
thing in testing.
The SixXS heartbeat client also was broken on recent systems, so we
have removed it. Please do not ask us to have it come back.

For the curious: there is a quick-hack SixXS heartbeat protocol client
available (pass is anoncvs):
$ cvs -d mirbsd-cvs@@mirbsd.bsdadvocacy.org:/ocvs \
> co -PA contrib/samples/codesnippets/hbclient

Please read the enclosed instructions.

@* wbx@@ why the fsck do we have two heartbeat clients in here?
* wbx@@ why is your port not even mentioned in Makefile?
* remove the other heartbeat port too; mention shell replacement for now

@Bring DJBDNS port up to date:
o fix errors in the Makefile (unescaped braces)
o regenerate patches with gdiff and manually separate them
  (this fixes a huge amount of line numbers!)
o update MESSAGE
o update PLISTs for @@extra stuff
o update PLIST6: the IPv6 flavour (no_ipv4) has /etc/dnsroots.global.v6 now
o update all global dnsroots with latest data
o remove a patch from the IPv4 flavour and put it to the IPv6
  flavour, which I suspect had broken the IPv4 location code (%lo),
  and which was not existent in the IPv6 code, where it should have been
o bump package patchlevel

Yet untested.

@add new djbdns ports
features:
 - one instead of three ports; selection done via FLAVOR
 - different flavours for ICANN, OpenNIC, ORSC and European-ORSN
   domain root servers (IPv4 and default only)
 -> the recent ICANN root name server move is integrated
 - Full integration (IPv6 only) of Felix von Leitners IPv6 patches
 - Partial integration (default only) of the IPv6 patches for
   IPv4 transport DNS servers
 -> http://www.fefe.de/dns/  patch revision: test19
 - consistent use of scripting, Makefile features and macroes
   leads to lean, readible port
 - tinydns installs to /usr/local/bin by default
 - home-grown diffs for more flexibility
 - all binaries are prefixed with a "6" (IPv6 transport only)
 - hand-edited diffs provide integral patch support

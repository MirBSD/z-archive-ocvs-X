@$MirBSD: ports/net/djbdns/pkg/SECURITY,v 1.1 2003/06/13 18:15:32 tg Stab $
(from http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/ad/security.html)

Security features: 

- dnscache runs as a dedicated non-root uid inside a chroot jail,
  so it can't touch the rest of the machine.
- tinydns runs as another dedicated non-root uid inside its own
  chroot jail.
- pickdns runs as another dedicated non-root uid inside its own
  chroot jail.
- walldns runs as another dedicated non-root uid inside its own
  chroot jail.
- dnscache discards DNS queries from outside a specified list of
  IP addresses.
- dnscache and the dns library use a new query ID and a new UDP
  port for each query packet. They discard DNS responses from any IP
  address other than the one that the corresponding query was just
  sent to.
- dnscache uses a cryptographic generator to select unpredictable
  port numbers and IDs.
- dnscache is immune to cache poisoning.
- tinydns, pickdns, and walldns never cache information. They do
  not support recursion.

Security metafeatures: 

- Security was, and is, one of the primary motivations for the
  development of DNScache. Every step of the design and implementation
  has been carefully evaluated from a security perspective.
- The DNScache package has been structured to minimize the complexity
  of security-critical code. The package is modularized for easy
  review.
- Bug-prone coding practices and libraries have been systematically
  identified and rejected.
- There is a US$500 reward for the first person to publish a security
  hole in djbdns.
- This is, however, only true for the "original" FLAVOR.

1.1
log
@add new djbdns ports
features:
 - one instead of three ports; selection done via FLAVOR
 - different flavours for ICANN, OpenNIC, ORSC and European-ORSN
   domain root servers (IPv4 and default only)
 -> the recent ICANN root name server move is integrated
 - Full integration (IPv6 only) of Felix von Leitners IPv6 patches
 - Partial integration (default only) of the IPv6 patches for
   IPv4 transport DNS servers
 -> http://www.fefe.de/dns/  patch revision: test19
 - consistent use of scripting, Makefile features and macroes
   leads to lean, readible port
 - tinydns installs to /usr/local/bin by default
 - home-grown diffs for more flexibility
 - all binaries are prefixed with a "6" (IPv6 transport only)
 - hand-edited diffs provide integral patch support

@o Incorporate Russel Nelson's "ignoreip v2" patch which can have
  djbdns return NXDOMAIN instead of A for specific IPv4 addresses
o Enable the "ignoreip-update" script (public domain code)
o Install the SECURITY file, if it exists
o bump pkglevel
(untested)

@djbdns is a collection of Domain Name System tools. It includes
several components:

- The dnscache program is a local DNS cache. It accepts recursive
  DNS queries from local clients such as web browsers. It collects
  responses from remote DNS servers.
- The tinydns program is a fast, UDP-only DNS server. It makes local
  DNS information available to the Internet.
- The pickdns program is a load-balancing DNS server. It points
  clients to a dynamic selection of IP addresses.
- The walldns program is a reverse DNS wall. It provides matching
  reverse and forward records while hiding local host information.
- The rbldns program is an IP-address-listing DNS server. It uses DNS
  to publish a list of IP addresses, such as RBL or DUL.
- The dns library handles outgoing and incoming DNS packets. It can
  be used by clients such as web browsers to look up host addresses,
  host names, MX records, etc. It supports asynchronous resolution.
- The dnsfilter program is a parallel IP-address-to-host-name converter.
- The dnsip, dnsipq, dnsname, dnstxt, and dnsmx programs are simple
  command-line interfaces to DNS. 
- The dnsquery and dnstrace programs are DNS debugging tools.
- The dnscache-conf programme sets up dnscache to work at once with
  root servers from ${FLAVORS}
- The axfrdns program can be used to exchange data with BIND servers.
  It is capable of AXFR and IXFR protocols.
- Except in the "original" flavour, dnscache can "ban" specified A
  records from being returned, rendering domains/hosts which resolve
  to these unusable, returning a NXDOMAIN. This can be used to "ban"
  wildcard second-level domains, such as those used by Verisign Corp.

log
@Merge import of OpenBSD source, ports and XF4 tree.

While here,
o clean up differences where possible
o whitespace cleanup
o ifdef ./. if defined()
o '...' ./. "..."
o echo foo > bar ./. echo foo >bar
o `...` ./. $(...) ./. $$(...)
o `...' ./. '...'
o modernize "our" tree, e.g. WWW in ports
o fix some typos and brainos introduced when renaming OpenBSD to MirBSD
o use hardware 80387 by default
o migrate Apache 1.3.28 OpenBSD ./. MirBSD ./. KAME
o work around as many CVS bugs as possible (add back/delete files, ...)

Synchronize stuff, ready for ongoing changes.

1.1
log
@add new djbdns ports
features:
 - one instead of three ports; selection done via FLAVOR
 - different flavours for ICANN, OpenNIC, ORSC and European-ORSN
   domain root servers (IPv4 and default only)
 -> the recent ICANN root name server move is integrated
 - Full integration (IPv6 only) of Felix von Leitners IPv6 patches
 - Partial integration (default only) of the IPv6 patches for
   IPv4 transport DNS servers
 -> http://www.fefe.de/dns/  patch revision: test19
 - consistent use of scripting, Makefile features and macroes
   leads to lean, readible port
 - tinydns installs to /usr/local/bin by default
 - home-grown diffs for more flexibility
 - all binaries are prefixed with a "6" (IPv6 transport only)
 - hand-edited diffs provide integral patch support

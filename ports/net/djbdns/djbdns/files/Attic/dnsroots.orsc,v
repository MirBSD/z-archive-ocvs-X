@Add DJBDNS port and UCSPI-TCP (dependant)

DJBDNS (http://cr.yp.to/djbdns.hml) is a Domain Name Server.
We have three flavours:
 - stable
	The original.
 - djbdns
 - djbdns6
	The versions with IPv6 RR support. djbdns handles
	queries via IPv4 and djbdns6 handles queries via
	IPv6, but does not include manual pages and other
	supplementary files.

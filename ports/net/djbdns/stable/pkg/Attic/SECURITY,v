@remove all traces of the "old" djbdns port triplet

@(from http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/ad/security.html)

Security features: 

- dnscache runs as a dedicated non-root uid inside a chroot jail,
  so it can't touch the rest of the machine.
- tinydns runs as another dedicated non-root uid inside its own
  chroot jail.
- pickdns runs as another dedicated non-root uid inside its own
  chroot jail.
- walldns runs as another dedicated non-root uid inside its own
  chroot jail.
- dnscache discards DNS queries from outside a specified list of
  IP addresses.
- dnscache and the dns library use a new query ID and a new UDP
  port for each query packet. They discard DNS responses from any IP
  address other than the one that the corresponding query was just
  sent to.
- dnscache uses a cryptographic generator to select unpredictable
  port numbers and IDs.
- dnscache is immune to cache poisoning.
- tinydns, pickdns, and walldns never cache information. They do
  not support recursion.

Security metafeatures: 

- Security was, and is, one of the primary motivations for the
  development of DNScache. Every step of the design and implementation
  has been carefully evaluated from a security perspective.

- The DNScache package has been structured to minimize the complexity
  of security-critical code. The package is modularized for easy
  review.

- Bug-prone coding practices and libraries have been systematically
  identified and rejected.

- There is a US$500 reward for the first person to publish a security
  hole in djbdns.

@Add DJBDNS port and UCSPI-TCP (dependant)

DJBDNS (http://cr.yp.to/djbdns.hml) is a Domain Name Server.
We have three flavours:
 - stable
	The original.
 - djbdns
 - djbdns6
	The versions with IPv6 RR support. djbdns handles
	queries via IPv4 and djbdns6 handles queries via
	IPv6, but does not include manual pages and other
	supplementary files.

@better find ssfe, better describe ssfe
@
text
@sirc is an Internet Relay Chat programmable client written
in perl and C. It has a main perl script that can be run in
'dumb' mode, standalone, and a separate split-screen front
end in C, called ssfe.
ssfe actually comes quite handy, you can use it for example
as front-end for netcat/telnet (MUDs) or bnbot (chatting).

It sends characters encoded by default in utf-8 to the server
and in iso-8859-1 to the terminal. Control characters are
stripped off.
The client has also support for sending iso-8859-1 on the wire
and any character set supported by p5-Encode to the terminal.

This IRC client supports IPv6: http://www.feyrer.de/IPv6/
DCC support is totally broken, though.

@sirc patchlevel 10:
* add back ssfe(1) programme and manual page
* bring ssfe about to the level of base
* some unifying and fixing
infrastructure:
* add HAS_SSFE_BASE according to the other ones,
  but defaulting to no (not needing patch in mpsup/)

  "broken" (i.e. not converted to latin1) utf-8 chars.
- fix addons

@Now we can update MirPorts from OpenBSD ports tree again,
that we have fixed pkg_install tools accordingly in both
stable and current, and that these tools are compatible.

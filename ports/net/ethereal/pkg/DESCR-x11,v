@Ethereal is a network protocol analyzer for Unix. It allows you to examine
data from a live network, or from a capture file on disk. One of the goals
of the project is to have an application that is similar in functionality
to Network Associates' NetXRay or the AG Group's EtherPeek. Although these
are both excellent products, neither of them runs under Unix.

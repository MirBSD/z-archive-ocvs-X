-echo \*\*\* IMPORTANT\! PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING\: \*\*\*
-echo
-echo We are trying to gather statistics on the number of BitchX users. In the source
-echo directory is the file \"cl.c\". This file contains a function that will send a
-echo single UDP packet to BitchX.com. The ONLY information that packet contains is
-echo the user\'s BitchX version and OS. This function does NOT interfere with the
-echo client in any way, and does NOT receive any information back.
-echo
-echo We are interested in this information for statistical purposes and to improve
-echo support for various operating systems. YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO CONTRIBUTE TO
-echo THIS EFFORT. If you would like to disable this function, remove the line
-echo \"\#define WANT_NOTIFY_BITCHX_COM ON\" from the file \"include/config.h\".
-echo
-echo The configuration script has finished. You should look through
-echo \"include/config.h\" and make any changes you would like to make.
-echo
-echo Now type \"$MAKE\" to compile BitchX.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

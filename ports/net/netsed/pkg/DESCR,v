@netsed is a small utility designed to allow you to alter the contents of
packets forwarded through your network in real time.  It is really useful
for network hackers in the following applications:

  * black-box protocol auditing - whenever there are two or more
    propertiary boxes communicating over an undocumented protocol (by 
    enforcing changes in ongoing transmissions, you will be able to test 
    whether the tested application is secure)

  * fuzz-alike experiments, integrity tests - whenever you want to test 
    the stability of an application and see how it ensures data 
    integrity

  * other common applications - fooling other people, content filtering,
    etc. -- choose whatever you want to

It fits well with the ngrep, netcat and tcpdump tool suites.

1.1.1.1
log
@Import OpenBSD ports tree as of CTM delta 3200,
this time with:
| tg@@n1:/usr/OBSD/ports $ cvs -qd /lcvs import -I ! -I CVS ports openbsd-ports ctm-3200 

This is necessary because of CVS shortcomings. The repository has been
manually prepared this time.

This is the last import to the ports tree before the release of
MirBSD#4 unless security issues appear.

1.1.1.2
log
@Now we can update MirPorts from OpenBSD ports tree again,
that we have fixed pkg_install tools accordingly in both
stable and current, and that these tools are compatible.

Consider MirPorts locked until next commit of ports/INDEX,v

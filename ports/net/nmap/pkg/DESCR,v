@Nmap is a utility for port scanning large networks, although it works
fine for single hosts. The guiding philosophy for the creation of nmap
was TMTOWTDI (There's More Than One Way To Do It). This is the Perl
slogan, but it is equally applicable to scanners. Sometimes you need
speed, other times you may need stealth. In some cases, bypassing
firewalls may be required. Not to mention the fact that you may want
to scan different protocols (UDP, TCP, ICMP, etc.). You just can't do
all this with one scanning mode. And you don't want to have 10
different scanners around, all with different interfaces and
capabilities. Thus I incorporated virtually every scanning technique I
know into nmap. Specifically, nmap supports:

     Vanilla TCP connect() scanning, 
     TCP SYN (half open) scanning, 
     TCP FIN, Xmas, or NULL (stealth) scanning, 
     TCP ftp proxy (bounce attack) scanning,
     SYN/FIN scanning using IP fragments (bypasses packet filters), 
     UDP raw ICMP port unreachable scanning, 
     ICMP scanning (ping-sweep),
     TCP Ping scanning,
     Remote OS Identification by TCP/IP Fingerprinting, and 
     Reverse-ident scanning. 

nmap also supports a number of performance and reliability features
such as dynamic delay time calculations, packet timeout and
retransmission, parallel port scanning, detection of down hosts via
parallel pings. Nmap also offers flexible target and port
specification, decoy scanning, determination of TCP sequence
predictability characteristics, and output to machine parseable or
human readable log files.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Now we can update MirPorts from OpenBSD ports tree again,
that we have fixed pkg_install tools accordingly in both
stable and current, and that these tools are compatible.

Consider MirPorts locked until next commit of ports/INDEX,v

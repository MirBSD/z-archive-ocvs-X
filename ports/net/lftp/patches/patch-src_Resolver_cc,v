@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

Lots of SECURITY fixes, at least:

 * databases/mysql: tmpfile issue
 * www/squid: acl bypass
 * games/xonix: privilege escalation
 * archivers/lha: buffer overflow
 * mail/exim: buffer overflows
 * net/rsync: path checking issue
 * net/icecast: buffer overflow

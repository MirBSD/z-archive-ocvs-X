@Sorry wbx, but there is absolutely no point in having net/samba3
when net/samba is already subdir'd.

Plus, you cloned even the same lame typo in the INSTALL script
you stole from an OpenBSD port, but removed their RCS Id. This
is what is called plagiarism, and there is one BSD project al-
ready which has fallen for this trap.

@The Samba suite is a set of programs which run under most UNIX and
UNIX-like operating systems. These programs deliver most of the important
functionality of a Microsoft Lan Manager server. That is, they support
remote access to UNIX filespace and UNIX printers from Lan Manager
compatible clients. In practical terms, this means that such clients
can connect to and use UNIX filespace as if it was a local disk drive,
or UNIX printers as if they were local printers.

Some of the most popular Lan Manager compatible clients include Lan
Manager itself, Windows for Workgroups, OS/2 and Windows NT.

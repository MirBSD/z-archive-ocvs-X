@Sorry wbx, but there is absolutely no point in having net/samba3
when net/samba is already subdir'd.

Plus, you cloned even the same lame typo in the INSTALL script
you stole from an OpenBSD port, but removed their RCS Id. This
is what is called plagiarism, and there is one BSD project al-
ready which has fallen for this trap.

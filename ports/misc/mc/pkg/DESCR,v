@The Midnight Commander is a directory browsing tool which bears a
certain remote resemblance to John Socha's Norton Commander for DOS.
It is feature packed:

	o Built in Virtual File System: manipulate remote files
	  systems through the ftp protocol. Midnight Commander's own
	  mcfs protocol has been disabled for security reasons.
	  Browse tar, compressed tar files, rpm, zip,
	  cpio, lha and rar files with a single click.  

	o All of the Midnight Commander operations work with the virtual
	  file system, enabling you to do complex tasks.

	o Key combinations for "vt220" and "wsvt25" terminals are fixed.
	  Fixing "screen" would be a bit harder, because it sends the
	  same keycodes for the F5 and F6 keys.

	o User files are saved in ~/.etc/mc/ instead of ~/.mc/ now.

	o Someone should really do some security auditing.

        o Note that the key binding to use the menu and to exit from
	Midnight Commander are F9 and F10 respectively.  Since OpenBSD
	uses these keys to swap VT's, you must hit 'Esc' + 9 and 
	'Esc' + 0 to use the menu's and to exit

@Now we can update MirPorts from OpenBSD ports tree again,
that we have fixed pkg_install tools accordingly in both
stable and current, and that these tools are compatible.

Consider MirPorts locked until next commit of ports/INDEX,v

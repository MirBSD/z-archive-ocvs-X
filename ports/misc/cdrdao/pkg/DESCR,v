@What does it?

 Cdrdao records audio or data CD-Rs in disk-at-once (DAO) mode based
 on a textual description of the CD contents (toc-file).
 
Why DAO?

 Recording in disk-at-once mode writes the complete disc,
 i.e. lead-in, one or more tracks and lead-out, in a single step.
 The commonly used track-at-once (TAO) mode writes each track
 independently which requires link blocks between two tracks. Older
 CD-recorder models forced a two second pause (pre-gap) between two
 tracks whereas newer models allow adjusting of the pause length in
 TAO mode reducing the number of link blocks to a minimal amount.
 However, with TAO it is generally not possible to define the data
 that is written in pre-gaps. But exactly this feature makes audio
 CD recording interesting, e.g. by creating hidden bonus tracks or
 track intros in pre-gaps like it is common habit on commercial CDs.
 Finally, DAO recording is the only way to write data to the unused
 R-W sub-channels for e.g.  CD-G or CD-TEXT.
 
Features

 * Full control over length and contents of pre-gaps (pause areas
   between tracks). Pre-gaps may be completely omitted, e.g. for
   dividing live recordings into tracks.
 * Control over sub-channel data like:
      + catalog number
      + copy, pre-emphasis, 2-/4-channel flags
      + ISRC code
      + index marks
 * Support for exact audio or data CD copying.
 * Tracks may be composed of different audio files supporting non
   destructive cut.
 * Accepts WAVE and raw audio files.
 * CD-TEXT reading and writing with drives that support it.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Now we can update MirPorts from OpenBSD ports tree again,
that we have fixed pkg_install tools accordingly in both
stable and current, and that these tools are compatible.

Consider MirPorts locked until next commit of ports/INDEX,v

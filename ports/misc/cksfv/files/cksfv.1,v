.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm

either writes the checksum to disc or compares it with a list
of valid filename/checksum pairs.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl i
Ignore case on filenames.
This is mainly a convenience option for broken filesystems.
Its use is deprecated.
.It Fl q
Be quiet, only printing errors.
.It Fl v
Be verbose, report matches too.
This is the default mode of operation.
.It Fl C Ar directory
Change to the directory before processing.
.It Fl f Ar file.sfv
Verify mode, compare checksums with these in
.Pa file.sfv .
.br
By default,
.Nm
generates checksums for the files listed on the command line.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Li $ cksfv -f naruto1\-5.sfv
.Pp
Verifies the checksums and existence of all files listed in
.Pa naruto1\-5.sfv
in the current directory.
.Pp
.Li $ cksfv -qiC naruto1\-5/ -f naruto1\-5.sfv
.Pp
Changes into the subdirectory
.Pa naruto1\-5
before processing, ignores file case and only reports errors.

@Check SFV (Simple File Verification)

Some files that you download will come with a .sfv file. This is
used to verify that the files that you received are the same as
the originals. cksfv is a program that can use the .sfv file to
verify the downloaded files. Also, it can be used to create new
.sfv files.

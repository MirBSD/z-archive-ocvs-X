@Initial revision
@
text
@Email::Find is a module for finding a subset of RFC 822 email
addresses in arbitrary text. The addresses it finds are not guaranteed
to exist or even actually be email addresses at all, but they will
be valid RFC 822 syntax.

Email::Find will perform some heuristics to avoid some of the more
obvious red herrings and false addresses, but there's only so much
which can be done without a human.

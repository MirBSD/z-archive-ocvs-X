+.TH IDIFF Local
+.SH NAME
+idiff \- interactive diff of two files
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B idiff
+file1 file2
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.I Idiff
+runs
+.IR diff (1)
+on the specified files and then
+presents each chunk of
+.I diff
+output and offers the user the option of
+choosing the ``from'' part or the ``to'' part,
+or editing the parts.
+.I Idiff
+produces the selected pieces in the proper order in a file called
+.IR idiff.out .
+.LP
+After each chunk is presented,
+.I idiff
+will prompt the user (with a `? ')
+for a command.
+The valid commands are:
+.TP
+.B <
+Take the ``from'' portion of the displayed chunk.
+This is the portion which
+was extracted from the first file specified.
+.TP
+.B >
+Take the ``to'' portion of the displayed chunk.
+This corresponds to that
+extracted from the second file specified.
+.TP
+.B e
+Invoke an editor on the chunk.
+The contents of shell variable EDITOR select the editor to be used.
+The default is
+.IR /bin/ed .
+Whatever is written out from
+.I ed
+will be placed into the final output.
+.TP
+.B q<
+Take all the rest of the '<' choices automatically.
+Think of this as ``quit from''.
+.TP
+.B q>
+Take all the rest of the '>' choices automatically.
+Think of this as ``quit to''.
+.TP
+.B !
+Pass the command buffer to the shell for processing.
+.LP
+All code that
+.I diff
+considers identical in both input files 
+is automatically put into the output file.
+.SH FILES
+.I idiff.out 
+\- merged output
+.SH BUGS
+It is not possible to pass any options to
+.I diff
+through
+.I idiff.
+Nor can you use `-' as a filename argument.
+.SH HISTORY
+.I Idiff
+appears in the book
+.I ``The UNIX Programming Environment''
+by Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike.
+.SH SEE ALSO
+.I sdiff (1)
+(side-by-side diff), a GNU tool that is included in OpenBSD.
+.I mgdiff (1),
+an X11 tool for comparing two files visually.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

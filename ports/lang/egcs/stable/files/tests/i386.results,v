@I've simply checked my test results against a run-of-the-mill installation
on a redhat linux system for differences...

Here are the differences:
-----------------------------------------------------------
FAIL: gcc.c-torture/execute/ieee/rbug.c execution,  -O0 
FAIL: gcc.c-torture/execute/ieee/rbug.c execution,  -O1 
FAIL: gcc.c-torture/execute/ieee/rbug.c execution,  -O2 
FAIL: gcc.c-torture/execute/ieee/rbug.c execution,  -O2 -g 
FAIL: gcc.c-torture/execute/ieee/rbug.c execution,  -Os 
FAIL: gcc.dg/980414-1.c (test for excess errors)
FAIL: g++.law/profile1.C (test for excess errors)
XPASS: g++.robertl/eb132.C (test for excess errors)
-----------------------------------------------------------
This is the test summary:

                === libio Summary ===

# of expected passes            40

                === libstdc++ Summary ===

# of expected passes            30

                === gcc Summary ===

# of expected passes            7490
# of unexpected failures        16
# of expected failures          7
# of unsupported tests          11

                === g++ Summary ===

# of expected passes            4220
# of unexpected failures        1
# of unexpected successes       2
# of expected failures          84
# of untested testcases         7
--------

Here is the corresponding test under gcc 2.8.1 (the actual numbers differ as
gcc does not support -Os)

                === gcc Summary ===

# of expected passes            6312
# of unexpected failures        42
# of expected failures          6
# of unsupported tests          11

                === g++ Summary ===

# of expected passes            3622
# of unexpected failures        462
# of unexpected successes       2
# of expected failures          221
# of untested testcases         7

There is one bug in gcc 2.8.1 that also shows up in egcs under standard 
OpenBSD configuration: if using -finline-functions, gcc emits stabs lines
for CTORS at an incorrect position. Hence, the linker no longer finds the
CTORS, hence everything breaks down. This has been reported to egcs-bugs.

The way we get around this problem is by relying on collect2: egcs is
built with use_collect2=yes, so it does no longer relies on stabs for
propert CTOR collection, and the bug is no longer visible.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

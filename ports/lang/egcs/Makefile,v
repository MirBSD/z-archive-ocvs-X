@gcc -system runs okay (means: it builds the three-stage
bootstrap and the c++ library) and succeeds the libexec/ld.so
regression test (my first self-written one :)

gcc -stable has been disabled now, because it lacks even the
ELF diffs, and I'm not going to maintain a non-propolice-enabled
gcc in my tree.
It must not be deleted though, because the directory is used by
gcc-system.

I have no idea whether
 - gcc 2.95 will leave the tree
 - gcc 2.95 will appear as a port
 - gcc 3.x will appear in the tree
 - tcc (from Fabrice Bellard) will appear in the tree

I can only say definitively that we'll have more fun with
gcc 2.95 in-tree and gcc 3.x as system compiler in ports
for another couple of weeks, maybe even months.

Let me make WineX/ReWind and maybe ISDN stable first.

@import gcc-3.2.2-propolice -system
This is a variant of GNU gcc 3.2 with integrated
propolice support, adaptions for i386-ELF and can
be used as system compiler.

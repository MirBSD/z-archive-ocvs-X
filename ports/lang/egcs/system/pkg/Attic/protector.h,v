1.2
log
@Merge import of OpenBSD source, ports and XF4 tree.

While here,
o clean up differences where possible
o whitespace cleanup
o ifdef ./. if defined()
o '...' ./. "..."
o echo foo > bar ./. echo foo >bar
o `...` ./. $(...) ./. $$(...)
o `...' ./. '...'
o modernize "our" tree, e.g. WWW in ports
o fix some typos and brainos introduced when renaming OpenBSD to MirBSD
o use hardware 80387 by default
o migrate Apache 1.3.28 OpenBSD ./. MirBSD ./. KAME
o work around as many CVS bugs as possible (add back/delete files, ...)

Synchronize stuff, ready for ongoing changes.

log
@Merge import of OpenBSD source, ports and XF4 tree.

While here,
o clean up differences where possible
o whitespace cleanup
o ifdef ./. if defined()
o '...' ./. "..."
o echo foo > bar ./. echo foo >bar
o `...` ./. $(...) ./. $$(...)
o `...' ./. '...'
o modernize "our" tree, e.g. WWW in ports
o fix some typos and brainos introduced when renaming OpenBSD to MirBSD
o use hardware 80387 by default
o migrate Apache 1.3.28 OpenBSD ./. MirBSD ./. KAME
o work around as many CVS bugs as possible (add back/delete files, ...)

Synchronize stuff, ready for ongoing changes.

@OpenBSD currently ships with a slightly modified gcc 2.95.3, which 
should be adequate for most people. MirBSD uses gcc 3.x as the
system C and C++ compiler instead and offers fall-back to gcc 2.95.

Selected changes:

* gcc 3.3 is much slower compiling than gcc 2.95.
* integrated preprocessor, somewhat better diagnostics.
* much better C++ support, almost fully ISO compliant.
* better C++ template diagnostics.
* better code generation, (scheduling on newer intel platforms), sparc64,
  and others...
* function at-a-time compile and tree based inliner, that should give
  better results than the old inliner.
* profiler-directed optimizations.
* built-in for mmx (needs new gas though) or altivec.
* integrated Ada and java(tm) compiler.
* more robust, especially where odd compile options are concerned.
* integrated propolice support.

@upgrade to gcc 3.3
integrate propolice support again (the one from gcc 3.2.2...)

notes:
 - not tested
 - i'd feel safer if someone knowledgeable would check
   gcc/config/i386/openbsd{,elf}.h RIGHT NOW!

@import gcc-3.2.2-propolice -system
This is a variant of GNU gcc 3.2 with integrated
propolice support, adaptions for i386-ELF and can
be used as system compiler.

@pull GNU libreadline
@
text
@As required by item 3 of the PSF license, here is a brief summary
of changes made to this version of Python for the MirPorts framework.

 * Support for MirBSD and ekkoBSD unames was added in the configure
   script.
 * The GNU libreadline port is pulled in, rendering Python GPL'd.

As MirPorts is a derivative from the OpenBSD ports tree, you will find
OpenBSD's changes in the file CHANGES.OpenBSD in the same directory as
this file.

1.1
log
@Unbreak on MirOS -current. Use a portable way to determine directory for
architecture-dependent files instead of hardcoding openbsd3. Add myself
as RESPONSIBLE. Document local changes as required by the license.

TO DO:
Repeat same steps for Python 2.1 and 2.2.
Adapt regression tests.
Testing on MirBSD -stable (comments please!)

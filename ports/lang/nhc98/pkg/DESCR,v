@nhc98 is a small, easy to install, standards-compliant compiler for
Haskell 98, the lazy functional programming language. It is very
portable, and aims to produce small executables that run in small
amounts of memory.  It produces medium-fast code, and compilation is
itself quite fast.  It also comes with extensive tool support for
automatic compilation, foreign language interfacing, heap and time
profiling, tracing, and debugging. (Some of its advanced kinds of heap
profiles are not found in any other Haskell compiler.)

log
@* do an espie and convert all MODULES= to new-style
* while here, sanitise subdir handling and flesh out
  all the flavoured subdirectory calls in the parent
  level Makefile into the directory itself for being
  easier adoptable
  (intermediate commit, I need to clean up the fall-
  out afterwards)

@The SILC Toolkit is a set of libraries that provide not only the full
protocol implementation, but also mathematical and cryptographic
utilities the developer will find handy when developing SILC
applications.

It provides a well structured, flexible and extensively documented API,
making it a good start point for anyone wanting to develop applications
in this protocol.

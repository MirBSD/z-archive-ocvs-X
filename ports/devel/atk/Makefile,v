@Update gtk+2 and dependencies to current versions, all patches from OpenBSD.

What this means is that instead of importing and then fixing, I pulled in the
patches, merged, fixed stuff and tested locally before committing.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Some applications that use glib2 (like Evolution etc.) may
be unstable if you use #7-stable or an older -current. This is because of a
fix that depends on a feature of the linker that was introduced about three
months ago. If you use a current snapshot, this should not be a problem.

@fearless and careful (at least in infrastructure/) attempt to merge [a-n]
of ports and take care of the changes.
expect _major_ breakage. porters, check your ports. I might have been tired.

The following things have not been updated:
* databases/db
* databases/openldap
* mail/mutt
* mail/p5-Mail-SpamAssassin
* net/irssi

Maintainers, to merge the conflicts, use
$ cd databases/openldap; cvs -d $CVSROOT up -PAd -jcvs-200312021610 -jcvs-200301141450
then find and fix conflicts.

Note: some files might have been added or "marked for deletion".
No need to restate that CVS sucks, this is already consensus.
So please check the "cvs up" output carefully (not only rcsmerge,
but also cvs and U ones - and M, you shouldn't include local mods).

@it's over, people

--
Usually, the BSD community _never_ removes credits (the MirOS COPYRIGHT
file being a pretty good example for that fact). However, the OpenBSD
people required me to remove their names from the MirPorts framework,
where it got imported to from the OpenBSD ports tree, and declared as
contributor of the port to OpenBSD. I can understand their privacy is-
sues, but still am not easy with this decision. However, I have to obey.

@Set USE_CXX=yes for the whole of GNOME 2.4.

Although it is written in pure C, the configure script bails out when
there is no C++ compiler available. This is due to some *really* buggy
autoconf macros by libtool et al.

I could not fix the problem itself before the new release, so at least
incorporate this work-around.

@Welcome to the wonderful (hah!) world of GNU GNOME 2.4

Note to committers: the HEAD branch differs from both
the OpenBSD vendor branch as well as your personal.

Even the OpenBSD team, which is _more_ friendly towards
the "cvs import" command, uses it only for _new_ ports.

Btw: you owe me 25 EUR, because I worked for a whole
     hour to fix this mess ;-) j/k

@Say hello to GNOME 2.4! :)

Known issues:
 * Nautilus image view does not work. To prevent crashes, use the
   following workaround: Select Desktop Preferences > File Management >
   Show Thumbnails > Never and click OK.
 * NLS seems broken and causes random crashes in the panel and the
   terminal. Unset LANG and LC_*.
 * To use antialiased fonts, you have to set GDK_USE_XFT=1. It is
   recommended to install the bitstream-vera-fonts package.

Have fun!

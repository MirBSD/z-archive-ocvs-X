@make this compile with gcc 3.4 (neutral for olders)
actual patch from openpackages. upstream says:
   ------- Additional Comment [14]#1 From [15]Owen Taylor 2004-04-29 12:04 -------
No further releases of GLib-1.2 are planned; I think you might find
a patch for glib-1,2 for this in the Red Hat RPM.

while here, new-style plists
(I hope I don't sound like espie...)
and size does matter

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

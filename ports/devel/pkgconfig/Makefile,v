@.if defined(MODGNU_CONFIG_MIRLIBTOOL)
ERRORS+=	Waldemar, nein. Pfui.
.endif

 * MODGNU_CONFIG_MIRLIBTOOL never existed, and thus is
   an error. Nuke it.

.if ${MODGNU_MIRLIBTOOL:L} != "old" && ${MODGNU_MIRLIBTOOL:L} != "new" && ${MODGNU_MIRLIBTOOL:L} != "no"
ERRORS+=	Waldemar, aus.
.endif

 * MODGNU_MIRLIBTOOL was a tristate for (no|old|new), defaulting
   to "no" unless CONFIGURE_STYLE contains autoconf, thus triggering
   to activate MirLibtool by setting MODGNU_MIRLIBTOOL to "old".
   Remove =YES occurrences.

[10:47] <benz> MODGNU_TWIDDLE_DIRS?= ${MODGNU_CONFIG_GUESS_DIRS}
[10:50] <mira> eek!

 * bsiegert@@ requested that MODGNU_TWIDDLE_DIRS, whose name I chose short
   so that it lines up nicely with CONFIGURE_STYLE and the like, dies and
   be reverted to MODGNU_CONFIG_GUESS_DIRS, even if it does more than that

### READ THIS ###

 * As a novum, MirLibtool-old has gone, so MODGNU_MIRLIBTOOL now
   defaults to YES if CONFIGURE_STYLE=autoconf, and has switched
   to a bistate. Thus, remove MODGNU_MIRLIBTOOL={old|new} assignments.

I'm saving commit messages for those people with poor internet again.

 * fix the tree, regenerate INDEX - 2841 unzels
 * remove MAINTAINER= (bad bad)
 * quieten "make index" for EMUL ports

All this was done via ed(1), so it needs testing (obviously) ;-)

@it's over, people

--
Usually, the BSD community _never_ removes credits (the MirOS COPYRIGHT
file being a pretty good example for that fact). However, the OpenBSD
people required me to remove their names from the MirPorts framework,
where it got imported to from the OpenBSD ports tree, and declared as
contributor of the port to OpenBSD. I can understand their privacy is-
sues, but still am not easy with this decision. However, I have to obey.

@Welcome to the wonderful (hah!) world of GNU GNOME 2.4

Note to committers: the HEAD branch differs from both
the OpenBSD vendor branch as well as your personal.

Even the OpenBSD team, which is _more_ friendly towards
the "cvs import" command, uses it only for _new_ ports.

Btw: you owe me 25 EUR, because I worked for a whole
     hour to fix this mess ;-) j/k

@Say hello to GNOME 2.4! :)

Known issues:
 * Nautilus image view does not work. To prevent crashes, use the
   following workaround: Select Desktop Preferences > File Management >
   Show Thumbnails > Never and click OK.
 * NLS seems broken and causes random crashes in the panel and the
   terminal. Unset LANG and LC_*.
 * To use antialiased fonts, you have to set GDK_USE_XFT=1. It is
   recommended to install the bitstream-vera-fonts package.

Have fun!

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

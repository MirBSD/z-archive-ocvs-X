@nuke CTM, it's been in the tree for 3 versions already
@
text
@CTM is a method for keeping a remote directory tree in sync with a
central one. It has been developed for usage with FreeBSD's source
trees, though other people may find it useful for other purposes as
time goes by.

This port uses the CTM kit developed by Giles Lean <giles@@nemeton.com.au>
for NetBSD, using sources by Poul-Henning Kamp <phk@@FreeBSD.org>.

OpenBSD source and cvs directories are available through CTM for those
of us who are firewalled off from protocols such as cvsup or anoncvs.

@Now we can update MirPorts from OpenBSD ports tree again,
that we have fixed pkg_install tools accordingly in both
stable and current, and that these tools are compatible.

Consider MirPorts locked until next commit of ports/INDEX,v

@Update gtk+2 and dependencies to current versions, all patches from OpenBSD.

What this means is that instead of importing and then fixing, I pulled in the
patches, merged, fixed stuff and tested locally before committing.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Some applications that use glib2 (like Evolution etc.) may
be unstable if you use #7-stable or an older -current. This is because of a
fix that depends on a feature of the linker that was introduced about three
months ago. If you use a current snapshot, this should not be a problem.

@Now we can update MirPorts from OpenBSD ports tree again,
that we have fixed pkg_install tools accordingly in both
stable and current, and that these tools are compatible.

Consider MirPorts locked until next commit of ports/INDEX,v

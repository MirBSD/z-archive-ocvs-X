1.2
log
@place a warning on top of every libtool thingie.
* ion definitively needs libltdl
* hfsplus looks fishy anyways
* most others should be fine with just mirlibtool
remove libtool-1.3 altogether

"<benz|lernen> gibt es einen extra-port für ltdl?"
i'll interpret that as "bsiegert@@ acks it grumpily" ;)
(the libltdl port will come)

@This is GNU Libtool, a generic library support script.  Libtool hides
the complexity of using shared libraries behind a consistent, portable
interface.

To use libtool, add the new generic library building commands to your
Makefile, Makefile.in, or Makefile.am.

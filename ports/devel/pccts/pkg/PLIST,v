@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

# Anyone who obtained a copy of this work is hereby permitted to freely use,
# distribute, modify, merge, sublicence, give away or sell it as long as the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

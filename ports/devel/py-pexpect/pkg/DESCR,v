@Pexpect makes Python a better tool for controlling other applications.

Pexpect is a pure Python module for spawning child applications; controlling
them; and responding to expected patterns in their output. Pexpect works like 
Don Libes' Expect. Pexpect allows your script to spawn a child application and 
control it as if a human were typing commands.

Pexpect can be used for automating interactive applications such as ssh, ftp, 
passwd, telnet, etc. It can be used to a automate setup scripts for duplicating
software package installations on different servers. It can be used for 
automated software testing. Pexpect is in the spirit of Don Libes' Expect, but 
Pexpect is pure Python. Unlike other Expect-like modules for Python, Pexpect 
does not require TCL or Expect nor does it require C extensions to be compiled.

@Now we can update MirPorts from OpenBSD ports tree again,
that we have fixed pkg_install tools accordingly in both
stable and current, and that these tools are compatible.

Consider MirPorts locked until next commit of ports/INDEX,v

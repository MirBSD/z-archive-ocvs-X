@fearless and careful (at least in infrastructure/) attempt to merge [a-n]
of ports and take care of the changes.
expect _major_ breakage. porters, check your ports. I might have been tired.

The following things have not been updated:
* databases/db
* databases/openldap
* mail/mutt
* mail/p5-Mail-SpamAssassin
* net/irssi

Maintainers, to merge the conflicts, use
$ cd databases/openldap; cvs -d $CVSROOT up -PAd -jcvs-200312021610 -jcvs-200301141450
then find and fix conflicts.

Note: some files might have been added or "marked for deletion".
No need to restate that CVS sucks, this is already consensus.
So please check the "cvs up" output carefully (not only rcsmerge,
but also cvs and U ones - and M, you shouldn't include local mods).

1.1.4.1
log
@Say hello to GNOME 2.4! :)

Known issues: 
 * Nautilus image view does not work. To prevent crashes, use the 
   following workaround: Select Desktop Preferences > File Management >
   Show Thumbnails > Never and click OK.
 * NLS seems broken and causes random crashes in the panel and the
   terminal. Unset LANG and LC_*.
 * To use antialiased fonts, you have to set GDK_USE_XFT=1. It is 
   recommended to install the bitstream-vera-fonts package.

Have fun!

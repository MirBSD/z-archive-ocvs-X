@B::Deobfuscate is a backend module for the Perl compiler that generates
perl source code, based on the internal compiled structure that perl
itself creates after parsing a program. It adds symbol renaming
functions to the B::Deparse module. An obfuscated program is already
parsed and interpreted correctly by the B::Deparse program.
Unfortunately, if the obfuscation involved variable renaming then the
resulting program also has obfuscated symbols.

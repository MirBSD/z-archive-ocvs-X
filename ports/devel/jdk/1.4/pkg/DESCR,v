@Java (TM) 2 SDK, Standard Edition
Version 1.4.2

The Java 2 SDK software includes tools useful for developing and
testing programs written in the Java programming language and
running on the Java platform.  These tools are designed to be
used from the command line.  Except for the appletviewer and
javaws (Java Web Start), these tools do not provide a graphical
user interface.

Flavors:
  native_bootstrap
    Bootstrap the jdk using a previously built and installed
    devel/jdk/1.4 package. NOTE: if this flavor is used without a
    previously installed devel/jdk/1.4 package, the port will
    build the jdk twice!

  no_plugin
    The Mozilla plugin is not built. If the plugin is not needed
    this flavor reduces runtime dependencies.

  no_webstart
    Java Web Start (javaws) is not built. 

  with_ipv6
    Build the jdk/jre with ipv6 support. When the jdk/jre is built
    with this flavor, java will create only ipv6 sockets by default.
    Since ipv4 to ipv6 address mapping is disabled on OpenBSD,
    using ipv4 addresses will fail. Consenquently, you may only
    use ipv6 addresses or you can start java with
    -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true and can only use ipv4
    addresses.

@Update subversion to 1.1.2.

Switch to bz2 distfile and @@lib for shared libraries. Don't even THINK about
installing this without the newest pkgtools.

1.3
log
@Update subversion to the all-new 1.1.0 release.

SECURITY: Versions <1.0.8 contain a security bug, please upgrade.

Subversion now depends on expat, but I discovered that it does not need Python
to build after all.

Also new is a small utility, written by me, to sync a cvs and a svn repository.
It even has its own, completely self-written mdoc manual page :).

1.2
log
@SECURITY: Update subversion to 1.0.3. Please update immediately.

Subversion versions up to and including 1.0.2 have a buffer overflow in
the date parsing code.

Both client and server are vulnerable.  The server is vulnerable over
both httpd/DAV and svnserve (that is, over http://, https://, svn://,
svn+ssh:// and other tunneled svn+*:// methods).

Additionally, clients with shared working copies, or permissions that
allow files in the administrative area of the working copy to be
written by other users, are potentially exploitable.

1.1.4.1
log
@Import subversion-0.34.0.

Subversion is a compelling CVS replacement. It uses Berkeley DB as its
backend and handles e.g. branches in a very sane way.

This port is based on work by Michael Paddon <mwp at qualcomm.com>. Things
I still don't quite like:

 * Plugins are named libfoo.so.0.0 and placed in lib/.
 * The port contains apr and apr-util. Splitting this off could prove
   difficult.

Please test.

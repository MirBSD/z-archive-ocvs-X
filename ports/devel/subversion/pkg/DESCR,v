@Subversion is a Free version control system. That is, Subversion manages
files and directories over time. A tree of files is placed into a
central repository. The repository is much like an ordinary file server,
except that it remembers every change ever made to your files and
directories. This allows you to recover older versions of your data, or
examine the history of how your data changed.  In this regard, many
people think of a version control system as a sort of time machine.

This product includes software developed by CollabNet
(http://www.Collab.Net/).

log
@Import subversion-0.34.0.

Subversion is a compelling CVS replacement. It uses Berkeley DB as its
backend and handles e.g. branches in a very sane way.

This port is based on work by Michael Paddon <mwp at qualcomm.com>. Things
I still don't quite like:

 * Plugins are named libfoo.so.0.0 and placed in lib/.
 * The port contains apr and apr-util. Splitting this off could prove
   difficult.

Please test.

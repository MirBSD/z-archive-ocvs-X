log
@Update subversion to the all-new 1.1.0 release.

SECURITY: Versions <1.0.8 contain a security bug, please upgrade.

Subversion now depends on expat, but I discovered that it does not need Python
to build after all.

Also new is a small utility, written by me, to sync a cvs and a svn repository.
It even has its own, completely self-written mdoc manual page :).

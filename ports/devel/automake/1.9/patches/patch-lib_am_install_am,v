log
@remove the dependency of 'install-am' on 'all-am'
this should fix most systrace issues, but libtool
still wants to relink its shared libraries...
luckily, there's at least no libtool in base, and
for ports, there's python stuff writing to WRKSRC
and WRKBUILD during install stage as root(!) any-
way, so the sudo before clean still must stay :-(

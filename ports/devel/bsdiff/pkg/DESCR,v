@* there is no net/samba3 any more, adjust Makefile
  bad me
* slightly modified port of bsdiff (binary diff/patch tools)
  From: Michael van der Westhuizen <michael@@skanky.homeunix.net>
  Message-ID: <3FF5C96F.5000808@@skanky.homeunix.net>
* pretty much unmodified port of proftpd (ftp dæmon with apparently
  bad security history, but some people prefer it, and since unix gives you
  the rope to shoot yourself into the foot, there's no reason to not have it)
  From: Robert Nagy <thuglife@@bsd.hu>
  Message-ID: <20040104210858.GA31978@@enterprise.hu>

I just commit the ports because the MirPorts people are apparently all
deep asleep; I didn't even get me through to test them, but since the
original posters say they work for them, we'll see.

@Tools for building and applying patches to binary files.

The tools included are:
 o bsdiff - Binary patch generation
 o bspatch - Binary patch application

These tools are analogous to diff(1) and patch(1) but deal specifically
with binary files. The binary diffs produced are significantly smaller
than those produced by similar tools (free and commercial).

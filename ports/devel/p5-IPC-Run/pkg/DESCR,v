@This perl module allows you run and interact with child processes using files,
pipes, and pseudo-ttys.  Both system()-style and scripted usages are supported
and may be mixed.  Likewise, functional and OO API styles are both supported
and may be mixed.

Various redirection operators reminiscent of those seen on common Unix and DOS
command lines are provided.

@I will never understand CVS, especially the import function. I don't know
why it imported my half-baked apr and apr-utils standalone ports along with
subversion. I am sure the command line was right.

@Import subversion-0.34.0.

Subversion is a compelling CVS replacement. It uses Berkeley DB as its
backend and handles e.g. branches in a very sane way.

This port is based on work by Michael Paddon <mwp at qualcomm.com>. Things
I still don't quite like:

 * Plugins are named libfoo.so.0.0 and placed in lib/.
 * The port contains apr and apr-util. Splitting this off could prove
   difficult.

Please test.

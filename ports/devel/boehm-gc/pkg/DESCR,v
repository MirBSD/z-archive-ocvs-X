@This port is really a buggy mess; don't be surprised if it doesn't
run correctly. The Boehm-Weiser garbage collection package, for C
and C++ - garbage collection and memory leak detection libraries.

A garbage collector is something which automatically frees malloc'd
memory for you by working out what parts of memory your program
no longer has pointers to. As a result, garbage collectors can also
inform you of memory leaks (if they find memory they can free, it means
you have lost all of your pointers to it, but you didn't free it).

C programs should run without change. C++ programs must include a header
to use garbage collection. See the man page and header files.

This package has two libraries and some include files:
libgc.a - a garbage collection library, replaces malloc/free/new/delete/etc
    with versions that do automatic garbage collection
libleak.a - a leak detection library, which is just libgc.a compiled with
    different switches.

C programs may be linked against either of these, and should run (with
GC or leak detection) without change.  C++ programs must include a header
to use garbage collection, though leak detection should work without
such source code modifications.  See the man page and header files.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Now we can update MirPorts from OpenBSD ports tree again,
that we have fixed pkg_install tools accordingly in both
stable and current, and that these tools are compatible.

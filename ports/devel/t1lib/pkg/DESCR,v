@Initial revision
@
text
@t1lib is a library written in the C programming language allowing a
programmer to generate bitmaps from Adobe (TM) Type 1 fonts quite
easily. These bitmaps are returned in a data structure with type
GLYPH. This special GLYPH-type is also used in the X11 window system
to describe character bitmaps. It contains the bitmap data as well as
some metric information. But t1lib is in itself entirely independent
of the X11-system or any other graphical user interface.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

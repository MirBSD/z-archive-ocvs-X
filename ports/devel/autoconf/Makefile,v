log
@add GNU autoconf v2.13 twice:
o autoconf/2.13 (AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.13) is the MirBSD version
o autoconf/2.13-o (AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.13-o) is what used to be
  the OpenBSD version, with adaptions for MirPorts
o remove @@pkgcfl, fix it (texinfo) instead
o fix 2.13-n patch files (OpenBSD RCS IDs, lost patch chunk)

Both of these have undergone quite some testing. It's recommended
that, before you alter configure.in, do the following:
o execute AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.13-o autoconf
o look if configure has changed (if so, note the changes; some people
  like to change only configure but not configure.in, for example
  because they are not familiar with autoconf yet)
o execute AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.13 autoconf
o look what changed between this and the previous run, report bugs
o do as you always did

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

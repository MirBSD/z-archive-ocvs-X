1.1
log
@add GNU autoconf v2.13 twice:
o autoconf/2.13 (AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.13) is the MirBSD version
o autoconf/2.13-o (AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.13-o) is what used to be
  the OpenBSD version, with adaptions for MirPorts
o remove @@pkgcfl, fix it (texinfo) instead
o fix 2.13-n patch files (OpenBSD RCS IDs, lost patch chunk)

Both of these have undergone quite some testing. It's recommended
that, before you alter configure.in, do the following:
o execute AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.13-o autoconf
o look if configure has changed (if so, note the changes; some people
  like to change only configure but not configure.in, for example
  because they are not familiar with autoconf yet)
o execute AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.13 autoconf
o look what changed between this and the previous run, report bugs
o do as you always did

@it's over, people

--
Usually, the BSD community _never_ removes credits (the MirOS COPYRIGHT
file being a pretty good example for that fact). However, the OpenBSD
people required me to remove their names from the MirPorts framework,
where it got imported to from the OpenBSD ports tree, and declared as
contributor of the port to OpenBSD. I can understand their privacy is-
sues, but still am not easy with this decision. However, I have to obey.

@add GNU autoconf v2.13 twice:
o autoconf/2.13 (AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.13) is the MirBSD version
o autoconf/2.13-o (AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.13-o) is what used to be
  the OpenBSD version, with adaptions for MirPorts
o remove @@pkgcfl, fix it (texinfo) instead
o fix 2.13-n patch files (OpenBSD RCS IDs, lost patch chunk)

Both of these have undergone quite some testing. It's recommended
that, before you alter configure.in, do the following:
o execute AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.13-o autoconf
o look if configure has changed (if so, note the changes; some people
  like to change only configure but not configure.in, for example
  because they are not familiar with autoconf yet)
o execute AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.13 autoconf
o look what changed between this and the previous run, report bugs
o do as you always did

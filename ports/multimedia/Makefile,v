* while here, sanitise subdir handling and flesh out
  all the flavoured subdirectory calls in the parent

  easier adoptable
  (intermediate commit, I need to clean up the fall-

@This is as far as I get with this transcode something.

such as gtk+, when they are available. This *MUST* be fixed
by the port maintainer.

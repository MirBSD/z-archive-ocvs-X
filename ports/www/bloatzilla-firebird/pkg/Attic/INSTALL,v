@burn firebird totally:
* the PLIST hints to the mozilla(TM) trademark, and I suppose it's
  hidden in the package at other places, including the artwork?
* I'm too lazy to fix the "need newer version" part; maybe we should
  just check for NO_CXX=yes || defined(MKC_EGCC)

@The Mozilla(TM) and Firefox(TM) trademarks prevent us from distributing
these ports, and the Firebird is not a trademark.

New ports being expected are:
 - ports/www/bloatzilla
 - ports/www/firesomething (or ports/www/firewhat; I'll leave
   it up to the maintainer)

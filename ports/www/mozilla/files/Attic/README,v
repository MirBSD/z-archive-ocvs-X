@			    MOZILLA for OpenBSD

In good OpenBSD style I stole the NetBSD mozilla port and turned
it into an OpenBSD mozilla port.  The OpenBSD patches are 42395
bytes long and include the 11448 of NetBSD patches.  However:

	      ***** MOZILLA IS NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME *****

I'm adding it to the OpenBSD ports for those that want to play and/or
get it to a state where it is ready for prime time.  Here are the
general caveats:

1) Only checked with lesstif 0.86.0, older versions will probably not
   work. Use the OpenBSD lesstif port -- it fixes a problem where the
   2.0 version of libXm.a overwrites the 1.2 version.

2) This warning is spit out on occasion

	    Warning: 
		Name: bookmarkList
		Class: XmLGrid
		Attempt to destroy dropSite info for widget that
	    hasn't been added as a dropSite.

   doesn't seem to hurt anything, though.

3) There are uses of tempnam, tmpnam, and mktemp that have not
   been looked at/changed yet.

4) It will NOT compile on a sparc with default optimizer settings.
   gcc blows up.  To compile on a sparc do this:

   make patch
   change line 257 of work/mozilla/config/config.mk from -O to -O0
   make

   HOWEVER: that only makes it compile.  Try to run and you'll get
   `Memory fault' in 5-10 seconds.  Perfect opportunity for sparc
   developers to get their debuging skills in shape :-)

5) I've used it less than 10 minutes on an i386.  It didn't crash
   in that time :-)

6) I've not tried to build it/run it on any other architecture.
   I suspect the usual problems wrt libraries on the alpha.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

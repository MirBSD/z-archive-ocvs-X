log
@Initial revision
@
text
@mod_text2html is an Apache module.  It is written in C and was
designed to replace Apache's internal text/plain handler
(the core handler found in http_core.c).  It has a couple
of key points.

1) It converts newlines to <BR>.

2) If it finds valid URLs it turns them in <A HREF> (and does 
   a good job of trying to not muddle up HTML that has 
   been flagged as text).

3) It converts '<', '>', and '&' to HTML entities.

4) Using the same method as the Unix file utility it
   determines if the file is text in the first place.  If it
   determines that it is not text it sends the files, but
   does so as application/octet-stream (so no nasty
   dumps of binary to the screen).

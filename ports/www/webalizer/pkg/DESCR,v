@Initial revision

@The  Webalizer  is  a  web  server log file analysis program
which produces usage statistics in HTML format  for  viewing
with  a browser.  The results are presented in both columnar
and  graphical  format,  which  facilitates  interpretation.
Yearly,  monthly, daily and hourly usage statistics are pre-
sented, along with the ability to  display  usage  by  site,
URL,   referrer,   user   agent  (browser),  search  string,
entry/exit page, username and country (some  information  is
only  available  if  supported  and present in the log files
being processed).  Processed data may also be exported  into
most  database  and  spreadsheet  programs  that support tab
delimited data formats.

The Webalizer supports CLF (common log format) log files, as
well  as Combined log formats as defined by NCSA and others,
and variations of these which it attempts to handle intelli-
gently.   In  addition,  wu-ftpd  xferlog formatted logs and
squid proxy logs are supported.

Gzip compressed logs may now be used as input directly.  Any
log  filename that ends with a '.gz'xtension will be assumed
to be in gzip format and uncompressed on the fly  as  it  is
being  read.   In  addition, the Webalizer also supports DNS
lookup capabilities if enabled at compile time.

The OpenBSD port enables Reverse-DNS lookup by default.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Now we can update MirPorts from OpenBSD ports tree again,
that we have fixed pkg_install tools accordingly in both
stable and current, and that these tools are compatible.

Consider MirPorts locked until next commit of ports/INDEX,v

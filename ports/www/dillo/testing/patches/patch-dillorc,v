1.1
log
@Add testing (CVS) version of dillo.

This version fixes the dreaded CPU-hog problem and has support for the
ftp and https protocols. It also features a non-broken bookmark manager.

The experimental frames-and-tabs patch is commented out, as it needs to be
updated upstream.

The distfile is a CVS checkout and is stored at our master site.

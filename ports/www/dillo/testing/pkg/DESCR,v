1.1
log
@Add testing (CVS) version of dillo.

This version fixes the dreaded CPU-hog problem and has support for the
ftp and https protocols. It also features a non-broken bookmark manager.

The experimental frames-and-tabs patch is commented out, as it needs to be
updated upstream.

The distfile is a CVS checkout and is stored at our master site.

@Dillo is a graphical web browser that's completely written in C,
very fast, small in code and binary. It basically depends on GTK+,
and renders a good subset of HTML, frames are managed same as lynx,
no jvm, no javascript.

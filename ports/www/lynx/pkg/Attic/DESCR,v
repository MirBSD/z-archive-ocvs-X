@merge CVS; fix here and there a bit

@lynx is a classical text mode browser for the world wide web.
An older version is included in the OpenBSD base installation.

This package features new colours, overall better look and
(especially table) rendering, more features and IPv6 support.

This version uses passive-mode FTP transfers by default, but
thanks to Andrew Basterfield's contribution to Lynx in OpenBSD
base, it falls back to active if passive fails, and vice versa.

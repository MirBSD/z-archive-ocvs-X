@The Mozilla(TM) and Firefox(TM) trademarks prevent us from distributing
these ports, and the Firebird is not a trademark.

New ports being expected are:
 - ports/www/bloatzilla
 - ports/www/firesomething (or ports/www/firewhat; I'll leave
   it up to the maintainer)

@The Mozilla Firefox project is a redesign of Mozilla's browser
component, written using the XUL user interface language and designed
to be cross-platform.

Firefox looks for plugins in ~/.mozilla/plugins
${LOCALBASE}/mozilla-firefox/plugins
and ${LOCALBASE}/lib/mozilla-plugins.

To make it look good you probably want some nice anti-aliased fonts,
like ${PORTSDIR}/x11/bitstream-vera-fonts.
To disable xft altogether set GDK_USE_XFT=0 in the environment.

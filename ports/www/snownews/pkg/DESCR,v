@* remove Waldemar Brodkorb as Maintainer as per his request
* merge MirXAWTV and OpenXAWTV
* merge import of the following ports:
  - databases/openldap
  - mail/mutt
  - mail/p5-Mail-SpamAssassin
  - net/irssi
  - www/snownews
* also, apply fixes so that irssi "might" build again
  (work by myself, even if I despise irssi totally)
* merge that another import again
* add back uvscan, uvscan_dat (XXX needs update!)
* remove calls to "sysctl -w kern.emul.foo=1" in PLISTs!
  no port is allowed to do such a change to the system!
* various minor fixes of rough edges which make more ports compile
* cosmetics in databases/db: no need to have four files,
  DESCR${SUBPACKAGE}, with identical contents

@Snownews is a text mode RSS/RDF newsreader. 
It supports RSS 1.0 feeds that comply with the W3C RDF specification 
and also supports Radio Userland's RSS 0.91 and 2.0 versions.

The program depends on ncurses for the user interface and uses libxml2
for XML parsing. ncurses must be at least version 5.0. 
It should work with any version of libxml2.

Features

  * Runs on GNU/Linux, *BSD, OS X (Darwin), Solaris 
	and probably many more Unices. Yes, even works under Cygwin.
  * Fast and very resource friendly.
  * Bultin HTTP client will follow server redirects and update feed URLs 
	that point to permanent redirects (301) automatically as recommended 
	by W3C.
  * Local cache for minimal network traffic.
  * HTTP proxy support
  * A help menu available throughout the program.
  * Automatic update checking (can be deactivated).
  * Few dependencies on external libraries; ncurses and libxml2.
  * Import feature for OPML subscription lists.
  * Fully customizable key bindings of all program functions.

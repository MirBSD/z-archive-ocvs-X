@* add pead-DB port by Benedikt "HaMa" Steinbusch
  few hints:
  - some files aren't included (see PLIST)
  - we don't need an empty ${PREFIX}/lib/php
  - wrap DESCR at 60, 66 or (if it must be) 72 cpl
    (I usually wrap them at 66)
  - remove apostrophe catastrophe from DESCR
* make both pear modules usable with both php4 and php5,
  controlled via flavours (php5 is default)

text
@DB is a database abstraction layer providing:
* an OO-style query API
* portability features that make programs written for one DBMS
  work with other DBMSs
* a DSN (data source name) format for specifying database servers
* prepare/execute (bind) emulation for databases that don't
  support it natively
* a result object for each query response
* portable error codes
* sequence emulation
* sequential and non-sequential row fetching as well as bulk
  fetching
* formats fetched rows as associative arrays, ordered arrays or
  objects
* row limit support
* transactions support
* table information interface
* DocBook and PHPDoc API documentation

DB layers itself on top of PHP's existing database
extensions. The currently supported extensions are:
dbase, fbsql, interbase, informix, msql, mssql, mysql,
mysqli, oci8, odbc, pgsql, sqlite and sybase.

DB is compatible with both PHP 4 and PHP 5.

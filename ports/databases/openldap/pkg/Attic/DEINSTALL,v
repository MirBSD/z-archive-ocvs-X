log
@openldap 2.1.25:
 - better backend , berkeley db 4.2.x
 - per default should be run as an unprivileged user (_slapd)
 - sql flavour removed
 - sasl flavour still in testing phase (will not compile, unless I update the cyrus-sasl2 port)
 - compilation tests with all ports depends on libldap in the tree, all compile fine
 - runtime tests with login_ldap, sylpheed{-claws}, pure-ftpd, mod_authldap, net-ldap, pine-ldap
   successful
 - I really, really hate libtool now

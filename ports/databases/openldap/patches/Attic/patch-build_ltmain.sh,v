@openldap 2.1.25:
 - better backend , berkeley db 4.2.x
 - per default should be run as an unprivileged user (_slapd)
 - sql flavour removed
 - sasl flavour still in testing phase (will not compile, unless I update the cyrus-sasl2 port)
 - compilation tests with all ports depends on libldap in the tree, all compile fine
 - runtime tests with login_ldap, sylpheed{-claws}, pure-ftpd, mod_authldap, net-ldap, pine-ldap
   successful
 - I really, really hate libtool now

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

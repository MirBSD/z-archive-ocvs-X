Sigh. Hope it works, please report any breakage.

@Initial import of my db4. This port is based on work by Gerardo Santana
Gomez Garrido <santana at openbsd.org.mx>.

 * Subpackages for -doc, -tcl and -cxx. Building without Tcl or C++ is
   possible.
 * Regression tests do not work. I need to investigate this.

Please test and comment.

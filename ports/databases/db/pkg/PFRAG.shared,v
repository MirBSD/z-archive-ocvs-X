1.4
log
@Now that db4 is the only db version in the tree, we can remove all those
compatibility kludges. Changes are:

 * Package has been renamed to db instead of db4.
 * Libraries are in ${LOCALBASE}/lib, headers stay in include/db4.
 * Documentation is in share/doc/db.
 * Utilities are now named db_foo instead of db4_foo.
 * Packages conflict with their old db4 counterparts.

Now is the time to update ports that depend on db4. See last commit
message for instructions.

@Roll back pathname changes for db. There is now only one db, and that is
db4. Ports depending on db4 should use a dependency like the following:

	LIB_DEPENDS=	db.4.2::databases/db

Please wait a bit with updating dependent ports, as I need to tweak some
paths in the port.

Sigh. Hope it works, please report any breakage.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

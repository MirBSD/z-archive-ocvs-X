1.2
log
@Now that db4 is the only db version in the tree, we can remove all those
compatibility kludges. Changes are:

 * Package has been renamed to db instead of db4.
 * Libraries are in ${LOCALBASE}/lib, headers stay in include/db4.
 * Documentation is in share/doc/db.
 * Utilities are now named db_foo instead of db4_foo.
 * Packages conflict with their old db4 counterparts.

Now is the time to update ports that depend on db4. See last commit
message for instructions.

log
@Roll back pathname changes for db. There is now only one db, and that is
db4. Ports depending on db4 should use a dependency like the following:

	LIB_DEPENDS=	db.4.2::databases/db

Please wait a bit with updating dependent ports, as I need to tweak some
paths in the port.

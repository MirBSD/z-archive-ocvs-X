@Remove Berkeley DB version 3. Only two ports depended on it, and they
were modified to use db1.85 in libc.

@Berkeley DB is a programmatic toolkit that provides fast, reliable,
scalable, and mission-critical database support to software developers.

Berkeley DB provides data management services for some of the most
demanding high-end server applications in the world. Vendors of
industry-leading messaging, directory, billing and provisioning servers as
well as the biggest portal, ASP and commerce sites on the Internet rely on
Berkeley DB. Berkeley DB's high performance and scalability support
thousands of simultaneous users working on databases as large as 256
terabytes.

At the same time, Berkeley DB's small footprint, in-process execution
model, simple function-call API and low administrative overhead make it
ideal for use in embedded systems. Vendors of telecommunications switches,
routers and wired and wireless network gateways choose Berkeley DB to
manage critical information in their products.

@Move db3 port do db/v3 and db4 to db/v4. This is what OpenBSD has done, too.
Sigh. Hope it works, please report any breakage.

@Now we can update MirPorts from OpenBSD ports tree again,
that we have fixed pkg_install tools accordingly in both
stable and current, and that these tools are compatible.

Consider MirPorts locked until next commit of ports/INDEX,v

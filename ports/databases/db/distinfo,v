@Update to 4.2.52.2. Also add MirBSD and ekkoBSD as supported OS types.
The patching of configure is not an oversight: It would be too hard to
adapt MirLibtool for this *cough* unusual directory structure.

@Roll back pathname changes for db. There is now only one db, and that is
db4. Ports depending on db4 should use a dependency like the following:

	LIB_DEPENDS=	db.4.2::databases/db

Please wait a bit with updating dependent ports, as I need to tweak some
paths in the port.

@Move db3 port do db/v3 and db4 to db/v4. This is what OpenBSD has done, too.
Sigh. Hope it works, please report any breakage.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

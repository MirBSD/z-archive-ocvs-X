log
@Roll back pathname changes for db. There is now only one db, and that is
db4. Ports depending on db4 should use a dependency like the following:

	LIB_DEPENDS=	db.4.2::databases/db

Please wait a bit with updating dependent ports, as I need to tweak some
paths in the port.

@Upgrade db4 to 4.2.50, requested by wbx@@

This release of the port should handle all shared libraries correctly
instead of the mess of previous versions. Code using 4.0.x or 4.1.x should
work without modifications in the source. db-4.2 is the preferred version
for e.g. subversion or OpenLDAP.

Attention committers: When importing from OpenBSD, please do not merge
anything in this directory. It is our own port, independent from OpenBSD's.

@Move db3 port do db/v3 and db4 to db/v4. This is what OpenBSD has done, too.
Sigh. Hope it works, please report any breakage.

1.1.1.1
log
@Now we can update MirPorts from OpenBSD ports tree again,
that we have fixed pkg_install tools accordingly in both
stable and current, and that these tools are compatible.

Consider MirPorts locked until next commit of ports/INDEX,v

@Chemtool is a small program for drawing chemical structures on Unix
systems using the GTK toolkit under X11. 

Chemtool relies on transfig by Brian Smith for postscript printing and
exporting files in PicTeX and EPS formats. Its companion program, XFig,
is recommended for enhancing the output of chemtool, and for creation of
2D diagrams and schematics in general.

Chemtool is a program for drawing organical chemistry structure formulae.
The interface takes some getting used to, but it works.

Tested on #7-stable, but not on -current.

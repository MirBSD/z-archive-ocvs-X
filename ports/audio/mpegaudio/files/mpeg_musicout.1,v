.Dt MPEG_MUSICOUT 1
.Os FreeBSD
.Sh NAME
.Nm mpeg_musicout
.Nd MPEG/audio Layer 1 and Layer 2 encoder
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mpeg_musicout
queries for all arguments, or
.br
.Nm mpeg_musicout
.Op Fl A
.br
.Op Fl s Ar sb
.br
inputBS
.br
.Op Ar outPCM
.br
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The encoder and decoder software are configured to output
the coded audio bitstreams as a string of hexadecimal ascii
characters. For greater compression efficiency, compile flag,
BS_FORMAT, in common.h can be switched to configure the bitstream 
reading and writing routines to process raw binary bitstreams.
.br
The decoder program has a very crude implementation of bitstream
synchword detection. It may not be able to correctly decode valid
bitstreams which have false synchword patterns in the ancillary data
portion of the bitstream.
.Sh RESTRICTIONS
The software implements levels I and II and psychophysical auditory
models I and II as described in the ISO 3-11171 rev 1 standard.
There are future plans to implement level III.
.br
The input/output audio data may either be headerless raw 16 bit data
or alternatively an AIFF formatted file (Audio Interchange File Format)
with certain limitations.
.br 
For more information on the AIFF format see the postscript file
/sgi/aiff-c.9.26.91.ps at the anonymous ftp site FTP.SGI.COM
(192.48.153.1).
.br
The AIFF formatted file is a convenient way for storing sampling rate
of the audio file.
.br
The encoder and decoder software are configured to output the coded
audio bitstreams as a string of hexadecimal ascii characters.
For greater compression efficiency, compile flag, BS_FORMAT, 
in common.h can be switched to configure the bitstream reading 
and writing routines to process raw binary bitstreams.
.br
This software has been run and verified on a large variety of
computers and operating systems. In particular UNIX, MS_DOS (with
MicroSoft C version 6), Macintosh, AIX Platform (RS6000) and Convex.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds

.It Sy inputBS
input bit stream of encoded audio

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

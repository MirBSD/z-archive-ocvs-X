@fearless and careful (at least in infrastructure/) attempt to merge [a-n]
of ports and take care of the changes.
expect _major_ breakage. porters, check your ports. I might have been tired.

The following things have not been updated:
* databases/db
* databases/openldap
* mail/mutt
* mail/p5-Mail-SpamAssassin
* net/irssi

Maintainers, to merge the conflicts, use
$ cd databases/openldap; cvs -d $CVSROOT up -PAd -jcvs-200312021610 -jcvs-200301141450
then find and fix conflicts.

Note: some files might have been added or "marked for deletion".
No need to restate that CVS sucks, this is already consensus.
So please check the "cvs up" output carefully (not only rcsmerge,
but also cvs and U ones - and M, you shouldn't include local mods).

@it's over, people

--
Usually, the BSD community _never_ removes credits (the MirOS COPYRIGHT
file being a pretty good example for that fact). However, the OpenBSD
people required me to remove their names from the MirPorts framework,
where it got imported to from the OpenBSD ports tree, and declared as
contributor of the port to OpenBSD. I can understand their privacy is-
sues, but still am not easy with this decision. However, I have to obey.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Now we can update MirPorts from OpenBSD ports tree again,
that we have fixed pkg_install tools accordingly in both
stable and current, and that these tools are compatible.

Consider MirPorts locked until next commit of ports/INDEX,v

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Now we can update MirPorts from OpenBSD ports tree again,
that we have fixed pkg_install tools accordingly in both
stable and current, and that these tools are compatible.

Consider MirPorts locked until next commit of ports/INDEX,v

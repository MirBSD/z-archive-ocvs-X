@Music Player Daemon (MPD) allows remote access for playing music
(MP3, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, AAC, Mod, and wave files) and managing
playlists. MPD is designed for integrating a computer into a
stereo system that provides control for music playback over a
local network. It is also makes a great desktop music player,
especially if you are a console junkie, like frontend options, or
restart X often.

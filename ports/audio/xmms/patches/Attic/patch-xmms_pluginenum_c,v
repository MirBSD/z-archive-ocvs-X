@Merge archivers, astro, and audio categories.

audio/mpg123: Thorsten, please merge it yourself if you want.
audio/faad: needs testing.

I forgot to say: The ports tree is locked until I commit INDEX.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

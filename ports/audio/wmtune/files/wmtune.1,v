.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
is a WindowMaker dock.app that controls AIMS Lab RadioTrack, Zoltrix,
Aztech/PackardBell FM radio tuner cards and cards supported by OpenBSD (native
mode).
.Pp
The
.Ql +
and
.Ql \-
buttons are for FINE tuning.
.Pp
The 2 buttons to the right of the FINE tuning buttons are the SCAN buttons.
.Pp
The 2 SCAN buttons also double as VOLUME UP/DOWN when using the RIGHT mouse
button.
.Pp
In the bottom left there is a small two digit box in which the currently
selected preset will be shown.
The
.Ql <
and
.Ql >
arrow buttons to the left of the box allow to switch between
presets easily and quickly.
.Pp
To the right of the above described things there is yet another button with
a miniature ON/OFF logo.
This is used to turn your radio card on/off.
.Pp
The button with the inscribed letter
.Ql A
allows you to control the internal alarm clock/delay timer.
Upon pressing the
.Ql A
button you will be allowed to set the timer/delay to a time you wish the radio
to turn on/off (depending on the current state of the radio) automatically.
.Pp
After pressing the
.Ql A
button the first time you may set the now displayed clock type panel to
the desired setting using the SCAN buttons to set your timer in the 24 hour
format (be aware in this state other buttons cease to work).
You must press the
.Ql A
button again at which point the indicator light will turn on and the alarm
will be set.
Lastly, pressing the
.Ql A
button once more, will disengance the timer.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

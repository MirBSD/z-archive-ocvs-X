1.2
log
@First batch of commits to replace LIBDIR and DYNLIBDIR.

Rationale: @@lib exists and works. The older versions cause problems with
Mac OS X and other stuff. And I'd like to have one transition that doesn't
take years ;).

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

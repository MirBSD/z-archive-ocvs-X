1.1
log
@Add a port for beep-media-player-0.9.7. Base from OpenBSD, MirOS adaption
and libtool tinkering by me.

NOTES: It works, but the only available plugin for output is esd. While
testing, I had to start esd manually with "esd -d /dev/audio". So esd should
be fixed to have the right device name to begin with. I also have to see if
it is possible to port the Sun Audio Plugin from XMMS.

Oh, and if you have xmms running and start bmp, it just exits as if it was
running itself.

@BMP is a multimedia player that currently uses a skinned user interface
based on Winamp 2.x skins.  It is based on ("forked off") XMMS.

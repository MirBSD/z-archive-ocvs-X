@To activate the services on boot, add the following
lines to /etc/rc.local, before the line saying just
|  echo '.'

|  if [ -x /usr/local/bin/svscanboot ]; then
|	echo -n ' daemontools'
| 	/usr/local/bin/svscanboot &
|  fi

Remember the directory /service needs be created if
it does not exist for this to work. (perm 0:0 0755)

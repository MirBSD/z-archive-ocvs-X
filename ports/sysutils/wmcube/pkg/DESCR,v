log
@Initial revision

text
@wmCube is a dockapp that displays a real time rotating 3d-object
and the current cpu-load.  The cpu-load also makes the object spin
faster/slower.  You can zoom in and out by clicking on the app and
you can design your own objects or use the objects that come with
the package.

* Objects can have infinite coordinates and lines/planes, your
  computers memory is the limit.

* If you're running a distributed.net client or some other
  application that keep you cpu at full load all the time you can
  make wmCube ignore "nice" processes.

* You can zoom out virtually to infinity and zoom in almost
  to the center of the object.

* You don't have to display the cpu-usage at the bottom of the
  dockapp, let the rotation speed be an intuitive way to determine
  cpu-load.  You can invert object speed vs. cpu-load.

* You can change objects at runtime by clicking the center
  of the app.  It will randomly choose a new object from the directory
  you specified at the command line.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Now we can update MirPorts from OpenBSD ports tree again,
that we have fixed pkg_install tools accordingly in both
stable and current, and that these tools are compatible.

Consider MirPorts locked until next commit of ports/INDEX,v

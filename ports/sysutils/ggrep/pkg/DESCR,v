@Initial revision

@The GNU versions of commonly used grep utilities.  Grep searches
through textual input for lines which contain a match to a specified
pattern and then prints the matching lines.  GNU's grep utilities
include grep, egrep and fgrep.

Note that this port will install these utilities with a 'g' prefix,
e.g. ggrep, but the documentation will refer to them without the
'g' prefix.

@The Linux-NTFS project (http://linux-ntfs.sf.net/) aims to bring full support
for the NTFS filesystem to the Linux operating system.  The ntfsprogs package
currently consists of a static library and utilities such as mkntfs, ntfscat,
ntfsls, ntfsresize, and ntfsundelete (for a full list of included utilities
see man 8 ntfsprogs after installation).

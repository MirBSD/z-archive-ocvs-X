@Initial revision

@The Ur-Quan Masters is an SDL-based port of the 3DO version of the
popular game Star Control 2.  This port is for only the program.
The uqmcontent port which contains all the graphics and sounds is
needed as well.  For a richer game experience, you may wish to
install the uqmcontent port with a non-default FLAVOR, which will
add enjoyable extras.

At this time, the introduction is not played.  It is highly
recommended to at least skim through the text version of the
introduction, a copy of which may be found here:

log
@Import OpenBSD ports tree as of CTM delta 3200,
this time with:
| tg@@n1:/usr/OBSD/ports $ cvs -qd /lcvs import -I ! -I CVS ports openbsd-ports ctm-3200 

This is necessary because of CVS shortcomings. The repository has been
manually prepared this time.

This is the last import to the ports tree before the release of
MirBSD#4 unless security issues appear.

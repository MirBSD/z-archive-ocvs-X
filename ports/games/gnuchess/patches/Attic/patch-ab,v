@fearless and careful (at least in infrastructure/) attempt to merge [a-n]
of ports and take care of the changes.
expect _major_ breakage. porters, check your ports. I might have been tired.

The following things have not been updated:
* databases/db
* databases/openldap
* mail/mutt
* mail/p5-Mail-SpamAssassin
* net/irssi

Maintainers, to merge the conflicts, use
$ cd databases/openldap; cvs -d $CVSROOT up -PAd -jcvs-200312021610 -jcvs-200301141450
then find and fix conflicts.

Note: some files might have been added or "marked for deletion".
No need to restate that CVS sucks, this is already consensus.
So please check the "cvs up" output carefully (not only rcsmerge,
but also cvs and U ones - and M, you shouldn't include local mods).

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import OpenBSD ports tree as of CTM delta 3200,
this time with:
| tg@@n1:/usr/OBSD/ports $ cvs -qd /lcvs import -I ! -I CVS ports openbsd-ports ctm-3200 

This is necessary because of CVS shortcomings. The repository has been
manually prepared this time.

This is the last import to the ports tree before the release of
MirBSD#4 unless security issues appear.

@.TH NETRIS 1 "1 August 1996"
.SH "NAME"
netris - a network version of t*tris
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B netris
[-DHRSh] [-w] [-c host] [-p port] [-k keys]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I Netris 
is a networked version of t*tris.  It allows either single player or head to head play via a network.  To play it single user, start
.I netris 
with no flags.  To play head to head, you can either host or connect.  To be the host, start 
.I netris
with the 
.B -w
flag.  To connect to a host, use the 
.B -c <hostname> 
flag with the hostname of the computer you wish to connect to. 

Unlike standard T*tris, 
.I Netris
gives you a little extra time after dropping a piece before it solidifies.  This allows you to slide the
piece into a notch without waiting for it to fall the whole way down.
In fact, if you can even slide it off a cliff and it'll start falling
again.  If you think it should automatically drop again in this case,
use the 
.B -D
option.

The keys are:
.TP
.B j
left
.TP
.B k
rotate
.TP
.B l
right
.TP
.B Space
drop
.TP
.B m
down faster
.TP
.B s
toggle spying on the other player
.TP
.B p
pause
.TP
.B f
make game faster (irreversable)
.TP
.B Ctrl-L
redraw the screen
.LP
To see usage information, type "
.I netris 
.B  -h
".
To see distribution/warranty information, type "
.I netris
.B -H
".
To see the rules, type "
.I netris
.B -R
".
To use a port number other than the default, use the 
.B -p
option.
.LP
You can remap the keys with "
.B -k <keys>
", where 
.B <keys>
is a string
containing the keys in the order listed above.
.LP
The default is:
.I netris
.B -k jkl mspf^l
.LP
You needn't specify all of the keys, for example
.B -k asd
will only
change the main three keys.
.B ^x
notation can be used for control
characters.
.LP
The
.B m
key moves the falling piece down one block, in addition to the
usual step-down timer.  Use this in repetition when "drop" would go
too far but you don't want to wait for the piece of fall.

.SH BUGS
.TP
One-player mode is a tad boring at the moment, because it never gets any faster, and there's no scoring.  This will be rectified at some point.  For now, use the
.B f
key (by default) to make the
game go faster.  Speedups cannot be reversed for the remainder of
the game.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

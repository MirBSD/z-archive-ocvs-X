@These are character-cell fonts for use with the X Window System,
created by Jim Knoble.  The current list of fonts included in this
package are:

  Neep (formerly known as NouveauGothic)

    A pleasantly legible variation on the standard fixed fonts that
    accompany most distributions of the X Window System.  Comes in both
    normal and bold weights in small, medium, large, extra-large, and
    huge sizes, as well as an extra-small size that only comes in
    normal weight.  Comes in the following encodings:

      ISO-8859-1  (Latin1, Western European + Icelandic)
      ISO-8859-2  (Latin2, Eastern European)
      ISO-8859-9  (Latin5, Western European + Turkish)
      ISO-8859-15 (Latin9, Western European + Euro Symbol)

  Modd

    A fixed-width font with sleek, contemporary styling.  Normal and
    bold weights in a 10-point (6x11) and a 12-point (6x13) size.
    ISO-8859-1 encoding only.

@Now we can update MirPorts from OpenBSD ports tree again,
that we have fixed pkg_install tools accordingly in both
stable and current, and that these tools are compatible.

Consider MirPorts locked until next commit of ports/INDEX,v

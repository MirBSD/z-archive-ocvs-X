@.if defined(MODGNU_CONFIG_MIRLIBTOOL)
ERRORS+=	Waldemar, nein. Pfui.
.endif

 * MODGNU_CONFIG_MIRLIBTOOL never existed, and thus is
   an error. Nuke it.

.if ${MODGNU_MIRLIBTOOL:L} != "old" && ${MODGNU_MIRLIBTOOL:L} != "new" && ${MODGNU_MIRLIBTOOL:L} != "no"
ERRORS+=	Waldemar, aus.
.endif

 * MODGNU_MIRLIBTOOL was a tristate for (no|old|new), defaulting
   to "no" unless CONFIGURE_STYLE contains autoconf, thus triggering
   to activate MirLibtool by setting MODGNU_MIRLIBTOOL to "old".
   Remove =YES occurrences.

[10:47] <benz> MODGNU_TWIDDLE_DIRS?= ${MODGNU_CONFIG_GUESS_DIRS}
[10:50] <mira> eek!

 * bsiegert@@ requested that MODGNU_TWIDDLE_DIRS, whose name I chose short
   so that it lines up nicely with CONFIGURE_STYLE and the like, dies and
   be reverted to MODGNU_CONFIG_GUESS_DIRS, even if it does more than that

### READ THIS ###

 * As a novum, MirLibtool-old has gone, so MODGNU_MIRLIBTOOL now
   defaults to YES if CONFIGURE_STYLE=autoconf, and has switched
   to a bistate. Thus, remove MODGNU_MIRLIBTOOL={old|new} assignments.

I'm saving commit messages for those people with poor internet again.

 * fix the tree, regenerate INDEX - 2841 unzels
 * remove MAINTAINER= (bad bad)
 * quieten "make index" for EMUL ports

All this was done via ed(1), so it needs testing (obviously) ;-)

@it's over, people

--
Usually, the BSD community _never_ removes credits (the MirOS COPYRIGHT
file being a pretty good example for that fact). However, the OpenBSD
people required me to remove their names from the MirPorts framework,
where it got imported to from the OpenBSD ports tree, and declared as
contributor of the port to OpenBSD. I can understand their privacy is-
sues, but still am not easy with this decision. However, I have to obey.

  This includes:
  * gnome 2.4.1(sic!) - a few USE_CXX may have vanished by accident *oops*
  * centericq
  * pine

* The ports tree is still locked until ports/INDEX is committed

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

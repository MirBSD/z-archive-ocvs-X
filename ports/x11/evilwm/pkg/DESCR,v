@sync with base evilwm

@A minimalist window manager for the X Window System.

'Minimalist'  here  doesn't mean it's too bare to be usable - it
just means it omits a lot of the stuff that make other window
managers unusable. Here is a list of features:
 * No window decorations apart from a simple 1 pixel border.
 * No icons.
 * Good keyboard control, including repositioning and maximise toggles.
 * Solid window drags (compile time option - may be slow on old machines).
 * Snap-to-border support (command line option).
 * Virtual desktops (compile time option).
 * Small binary size (even with everything turned on).

This port differs from the in-tree evilwm of MirOS-current in that
it does not restore the old, pre-evilwm-0.99.14, move behaviour.

Available flavours:

 * unpatched
	This flavour yields a pristine evilem without MirOS
	patches or changed functionality.
 * miros (default)
	This flavour restores the old move behaviour, thus
	yielding the same evilwm as contained in MirOS xbase.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Now we can update MirPorts from OpenBSD ports tree again,
that we have fixed pkg_install tools accordingly in both
stable and current, and that these tools are compatible.

Consider MirPorts locked until next commit of ports/INDEX,v

@* do an espie and convert all MODULES= to new-style
* while here, sanitise subdir handling and flesh out
  all the flavoured subdirectory calls in the parent
  level Makefile into the directory itself for being
  easier adoptable
  (intermediate commit, I need to clean up the fall-
  out afterwards)
* prepare for great unification of subdir-mks

that we have fixed pkg_install tools accordingly in both
stable and current, and that these tools are compatible.

Consider MirPorts locked until next commit of ports/INDEX,v

@SECURITY UPDATE mplayer to 0.92
<<<                                                         MPLAYERHQ:HU _ THE MOVIE PLAYER FOR LINUX (p6 of 26)
   2003.09.25, Thursday :: Exploitable remote buffer overflow vulnerability in MPlayer
   posted by Gabucino

   Severity:
   HIGH (if playing ASX streaming content)
   LOW (if playing only normal files)

   Description:
   A remotely exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability was found in MPlayer. A malicious host can craft a
   harmful ASX header, and trick MPlayer into executing arbitrary code upon parsing that header.

   MPlayer versions affected:
   MPlayer 0.90pre series
   MPlayer 0.90rc series
   MPlayer 0.90
   MPlayer 0.91
   MPlayer 1.0pre1

   MPlayer versions unaffected:
   MPlayer releases before 0.90pre1
   MPlayer 0.92
   MPlayer HEAD CVS

   Notification status:
   Developers were notified on 2003.09.24
   Fix was commited into HEAD CVS at 2003.09.25 02:36:36 CEST
   MPlayer 0.92 (vuln-fix-only release) was released on 2003.09.25 12:00:00 CEST

   Patch availability:
   A patch is available for all vulnerable versions [37]here.

   Suggested upgrading methods:
   MPlayer 1.0pre1 users should upgrade to latest CVS
   MPlayer 0.91 (and below) users should upgrade to 0.92 OR latest CVS

   MPlayer 0.92 is downloadable from the following sites:
     * Hungary 1, HTTP -> [38]http://www1.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/MPlayer-0.92.tar.bz2

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

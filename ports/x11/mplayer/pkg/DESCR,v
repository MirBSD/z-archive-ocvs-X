@long awaited (*punches bsiegert@@*) update
- add caca flavour
- use internal faad by default (no_faad flavour becomes faad)
- use internal matroska by default (no_mkv flavour becomes mkv)
- add support for bt8xx television (tho I think TV should be banned)

@MPlayer is a movie player for GNU/Linux (runs on many other Unices, and
non-x86 CPUs, see the documentation). It plays most MPEG, VOB, AVI,
VIVO, ASF/WMV, QT/MOV, FLI, NuppelVideo, yuv4mpeg, FILM, RoQ, and some
RealMedia files, supported by many native, XAnim, and Win32 DLL codecs.
You can watch VideoCD, SVCD, DVD, 3ivx, FLI, and even DivX movies too
(and you don't need the avifile library at all!).

Another big feature of mplayer is the wide range of supported output
drivers.  It works with X11, Xv, DGA, OpenGL, SVGAlib, fbdev, AAlib, but
you can use SDL (and this way all drivers of SDL), VESA (on every VESA
compatible card, even without X!), and some lowlevel card-specific
drivers (for Matrox, 3Dfx and Radeon) too! Most of them supports
software or hardware scaling, so you can enjoy movies in fullscreen.
MPlayer supports displaying through some hardware MPEG decoder boards,
such as the DVB and DXR3/Hollywood+ !  And what about the nice big
antialiased shaded subtitles (9 supported types!!!) with european/ISO
8859-1,2 (hungarian, english, czech, etc), cyrillic, korean fonts, and
OSD?

MPlayer might fail due to lack of shared memory, eg. when using gui mode
under KDE.  Starting with OpenBSD 3.3, sysctl(8) can modify the shared
memory parameters. In particular kern.shminfo.shmall might need to
be raised, eg.

sysctl -w kern.shminfo.shmall=32768


Flavors:

  arts: enables arts, requires x11/kde/arts3

  esd: enables esd, requires audio/esound

  sdl: enables sdl, requires devel/sdl

  ggi: enables ggi, requires graphics/ggi

  debug: enables debugging information

  mad: enables mad, requires audio/libmad

  no_x11: disables gui and most video output.

  aa: enables ascii art, requires graphics/aalib

  caca: enables colourized ascii art, requires graphics/libcaca

  win32: enables win32 codecs (i386-only)  To use this flavor, you
	need to enable the machdep.userldt sysctl, either via
	/etc/sysctl.conf, or by entering (as root):
		sysctl -w machdep.userldt=1

  no_live, no_ungif: disables C++ code enabled by default
	FAAD is a MPEG-4 and DivX decoder; LIVE is a common stream
	format; UNGIF is a CompuServe GIF decoder; MKV is the
	rare Matroska format used by some Anime subbers

  mkv: enables external .mkv support, requires graphics/libmatroska

  faad: enables external FAAD support, requires audio/faad

@SECURITY UPDATE mplayer to 0.92
<<<                                                         MPLAYERHQ:HU _ THE MOVIE PLAYER FOR LINUX (p6 of 26)
   2003.09.25, Thursday :: Exploitable remote buffer overflow vulnerability in MPlayer
   posted by Gabucino

   Severity:
   HIGH (if playing ASX streaming content)
   LOW (if playing only normal files)

   Description:
   A remotely exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability was found in MPlayer. A malicious host can craft a
   harmful ASX header, and trick MPlayer into executing arbitrary code upon parsing that header.

   MPlayer versions affected:
   MPlayer 0.90pre series
   MPlayer 0.90rc series
   MPlayer 0.90
   MPlayer 0.91
   MPlayer 1.0pre1

   MPlayer versions unaffected:
   MPlayer releases before 0.90pre1
   MPlayer 0.92
   MPlayer HEAD CVS

   Notification status:
   Developers were notified on 2003.09.24
   Fix was commited into HEAD CVS at 2003.09.25 02:36:36 CEST
   MPlayer 0.92 (vuln-fix-only release) was released on 2003.09.25 12:00:00 CEST

   Patch availability:
   A patch is available for all vulnerable versions [37]here.

   Suggested upgrading methods:
   MPlayer 1.0pre1 users should upgrade to latest CVS
   MPlayer 0.91 (and below) users should upgrade to 0.92 OR latest CVS

   MPlayer 0.92 is downloadable from the following sites:
     * Hungary 1, HTTP -> [38]http://www1.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/MPlayer-0.92.tar.bz2
     * Hungary 1, FTP -> [39]ftp://ftp1.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/MPlayer-0.92.tar.bz2

@Gnome-print is a high-quality printing framework for GNOME. Gnome-print
implements: 

* device-independent printing API, modelled loosely after
  PostScript language.
* font abstraction that allows device-independent text
  display (within reasonable limits).
* powerful configuration engine, dealing with all levels
  of output pipeline set of actual printer drivers
  (PostScript, PDF, fax).
* print preview widget.
* printer selector widget.

This package contains the cups plugin for GNOME-Print.

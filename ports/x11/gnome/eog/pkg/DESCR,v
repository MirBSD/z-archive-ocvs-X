1.1
log
@Add a port for eog-2.8.2, from OpenBSD.

This is supposed to be the graphics viewer inside nautilus, but it works
only as a stand-alone application for me. (At least it works.) Sigh.

text
@This is the Eye of Gnome, an image viewer program.  It is meant to be a
fast and functional image viewer as well as an image cataloging program.

This version builds with gtk+2 and gnome2.

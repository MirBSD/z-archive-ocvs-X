@Merge changes from OpenBSD CVS for GNOME 2.4. This should unbreak SVG icons
among other things.

@Gdm (the GNOME Display Manager) is a highly configurable
reimplementation of xdm, the X Display Manager. Gdm allows you to log
into your system with the X Window System running and supports running
several different X sessions on your local machine at the same time.

@Now we can update MirPorts from OpenBSD ports tree again,
that we have fixed pkg_install tools accordingly in both

1.1.4.1
log
@Say hello to GNOME 2.4! :)

Known issues: 
 * Nautilus image view does not work. To prevent crashes, use the 
   following workaround: Select Desktop Preferences > File Management >
   Show Thumbnails > Never and click OK.
 * NLS seems broken and causes random crashes in the panel and the
   terminal. Unset LANG and LC_*.
 * To use antialiased fonts, you have to set GDK_USE_XFT=1. It is 
   recommended to install the bitstream-vera-fonts package.

Have fun!

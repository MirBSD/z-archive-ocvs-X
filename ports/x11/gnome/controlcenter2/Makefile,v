@it's over, people

--
Usually, the BSD community _never_ removes credits (the MirOS COPYRIGHT
file being a pretty good example for that fact). However, the OpenBSD
people required me to remove their names from the MirPorts framework,
where it got imported to from the OpenBSD ports tree, and declared as
contributor of the port to OpenBSD. I can understand their privacy is-
sues, but still am not easy with this decision. However, I have to obey.

@Set USE_CXX=yes for the whole of GNOME 2.4.

Although it is written in pure C, the configure script bails out when
there is no C++ compiler available. This is due to some *really* buggy
autoconf macros by libtool et al.

I could not fix the problem itself before the new release, so at least
incorporate this work-around.

@Welcome to the wonderful (hah!) world of GNU GNOME 2.4

Note to committers: the HEAD branch differs from both
the OpenBSD vendor branch as well as your personal.

Even the OpenBSD team, which is _more_ friendly towards
the "cvs import" command, uses it only for _new_ ports.

Btw: you owe me 25 EUR, because I worked for a whole
     hour to fix this mess ;-) j/k

@Say hello to GNOME 2.4! :)

Known issues:
 * Nautilus image view does not work. To prevent crashes, use the
   following workaround: Select Desktop Preferences > File Management >
   Show Thumbnails > Never and click OK.
 * NLS seems broken and causes random crashes in the panel and the
   terminal. Unset LANG and LC_*.
 * To use antialiased fonts, you have to set GDK_USE_XFT=1. It is
   recommended to install the bitstream-vera-fonts package.

Have fun!

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time

* Please, everyone, make sure your ports still work.

  This includes:
  * gnome 2.4.1(sic!) - a few USE_CXX may have vanished by accident *oops*
  * centericq
  * pine

* The ports tree is still locked until ports/INDEX is committed

@Welcome to the wonderful (hah!) world of GNU GNOME 2.4

Note to committers: the HEAD branch differs from both
the OpenBSD vendor branch as well as your personal.

Even the OpenBSD team, which is _more_ friendly towards
the "cvs import" command, uses it only for _new_ ports.

Btw: you owe me 25 EUR, because I worked for a whole
     hour to fix this mess ;-) j/k

log
@Say hello to GNOME 2.4! :)

Known issues:
 * Nautilus image view does not work. To prevent crashes, use the
   following workaround: Select Desktop Preferences > File Management >
   Show Thumbnails > Never and click OK.
 * NLS seems broken and causes random crashes in the panel and the
   terminal. Unset LANG and LC_*.
 * To use antialiased fonts, you have to set GDK_USE_XFT=1. It is
   recommended to install the bitstream-vera-fonts package.

Have fun!

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

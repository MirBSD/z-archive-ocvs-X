1.2
log
@Update Windowmaker to 0.91.0.

Lots of work with the patches. Languages (wmaker-lang) continue to be
supported. libwraster soname has been bumped: We had 4.0 back when upstream
was at 3.x; now they have 4.0.1, we have 5.0. Hardcoded locations of
/usr/local in the code have been made dynamic. The minimum freetype version
has been lowered to 2.1.0 (upstream wants 2.1.2) because this is the version
in -stable and even -current.

Configuration files are now in /etc/WindowMaker where they belong and use
@@sample.

@Now we can update MirPorts from OpenBSD ports tree again,
that we have fixed pkg_install tools accordingly in both
stable and current, and that these tools are compatible.

Consider MirPorts locked until next commit of ports/INDEX,v

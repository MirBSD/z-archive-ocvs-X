log
@* convert to MirLibtool
* add hidden gettext dependency
* fix detecting gettext
* disable NLS, because lib-link.m4 has a bug which prevents
  the shared library from being pulled in (we don't have a
  libintl.so symlink) and I'm not going to fix that
  => we only lose german, japanese and chinese I18N for mlconfig
* regenerate PLIST

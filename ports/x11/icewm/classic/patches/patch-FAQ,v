   places - the location depends upon the method you used to install
   IceWM.
 
-  In a plain vanilla source install, the global version of the files
-  will be located in "/usr/local/lib/Xll/icewm/". If you installed the
-  standard RPM, they will be in "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/icewm/". The system
-  wide configuration files for the Debian package seem to be in
-  "/etc/X11/icewm/".
+  The global version of the files is in "/usr/local/share/icewm/".
+  The system wide configuration files are in "/etc/icewm/".
 
   However, if you wish to make a configuration of your own you should
   not edit these global config files but create a subdirectory of your
-  home directory called ".icewm/". Copy the system wide files to your
-  local ".icewm" directory and edit these copies.
+  home directory called ".etc/icewm/". Copy the system wide files to your

   Note: You may have to alter the permissions of the copies in order to
   read and write to them.

   often done in a hurry and if you have to scan through a menu this will
   increase the chance that you will not lock your machine at all.

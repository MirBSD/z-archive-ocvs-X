@IceWM 1.0.9-2 (classic), pretty much the one we always had
I removed the OpenBSD mascot and put a (c) of Mr McKusick
on the BSD Daemon XPM file.

@IceWM is a window manager for the X11 Window System. It has been
coded from scratch in C++ for performance and size and attempts to
achieve the following goals:

      Feel good and fast to use, be simple and don't get in the way
      Default configuration should be fully usable without tweaking
      Mouse is optional
      Combine the best features of other window managers and GUIs
      Consume even less ressources than twm

IceWM allows reasonably configurable look using themes and is fully
GNOME and partially KDE compliant, but can also be used as a full
featured standalone environment.

This is the classic 1.0 series of IceWM, recommended for beginners.
Have a look at the metal2 theme, as well as the default theme.

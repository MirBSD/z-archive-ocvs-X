@add back both IceWM ports
note: I've not tested the new one, should work tho
also, if someone wants to copy the daemon into that...

@A lightweight window manager for the X Window System. Optimized for
"feel" and speed, not looks. Features multiple workspaces, opaque
move/resize, task bar, window list, clock, mailbox, CPU, Network,
APM status.

This is the new, more modular IceWM. Feels a bit more difficult
to install and handle, and looks different from classic IceWM.

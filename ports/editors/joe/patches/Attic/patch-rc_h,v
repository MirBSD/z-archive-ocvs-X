@update to joe-3.1jupp3 (by MirOS Project)
works on
- MirOS #7-current/i386
- NetBSD 1.6.1/pmax
- Mac OSX 10.3.8/powerpc
- Solaris 8/sparc64
jupprc should work as-is under DOS, too; the
source not yet since it depends on __attribute__
(it's on my list)

@joe-2.8 dies, without prejudice
joe-3.1 with my patches has proven more stable with not much more bloat,
and the utf-8 support (in uxterm) rocks. joe-2.8 also didn't work on the
timet64 arches, whereas it 'should' be possible to build joe-3.1 for the
other OSses (DOS maybe, Interix definitively).

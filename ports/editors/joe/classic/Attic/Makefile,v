@joe-2.8 dies, without prejudice
joe-3.1 with my patches has proven more stable with not much more bloat,
and the utf-8 support (in uxterm) rocks. joe-2.8 also didn't work on the
timet64 arches, whereas it 'should' be possible to build joe-3.1 for the
other OSses (DOS maybe, Interix definitively).

1.1
log
@
The ports/editors/jupp port wanders to ports/editors/joe/classic
and gets polishing. Documentation is becoming installed.

The jupprc file wanders to a common filesdir for all joe ports,
and gets some updates and stripping.

The old joe-2.9preXXX port gets nuked.

A new port is done from scratch for joe-3.1, influencing my
fixes to the joe-2.8 port, and put into ports/editors/joe/modern
This port includes jupp and documentation as well.

It says it has utf-8 support, but I can't test that since it
thinks, then, my terminal would be utf-8 as well.
It tabcompletes within the search'n'replace dialogue. Bad.

@update to joe-3.1jupp3 (by MirOS Project)
works on
- MirOS #7-current/i386
- NetBSD 1.6.1/pmax
- Mac OSX 10.3.8/powerpc
- Solaris 8/sparc64
jupprc should work as-is under DOS, too; the
source not yet since it depends on __attribute__
(it's on my list)

@"Joe is world-famous Wordstar like text editor."
		-- Sourcefrog

joe is the professional freeware ASCII text screen editor for
UNIX(R). It makes full use of the power and versatility of UNIX,
but lacks the steep learning curve and basic nonsense you have
to deal with in every other UNIX editor. joe has the feel of
most IBM PC text editors: The key-sequences are reminiscent of
WordStar and Turbo-C. joe is much more powerful than those edi-
tors, however. joe has all of the features a UNIX user should
expect: full use of termcap/terminfo, excellent screen update
optimizations (joe is fully useable at 2400 baud), simple in-
stallation, and all of the UNIX-integration features of vi.

jupp is a customisation of joe which provides easy conversion
for former PC users as well as powerfulness for programmers,
while not doing things "automagically" (word wrap, indenting,
highlighting, to name a few).

This is joe-3.x-jupp<y>, a GNU GPL version 1 licenced fork
of the current state-of-the-art JOE editor from Sourceforge,
with Joe H. Allen himself starting development again after
over eight years. The MirOS fork has added UTF-8 Support for
non-LOCALE-aware operating systems (such as OpenBSD and MirOS),
the "jupp" flavour and not doing tab completion in the search
and replace dialogues, as well as -Wall -Werror fixes, numerous
small nits and security stuff.

The ports/editors/jupp port wanders to ports/editors/joe/classic
and gets polishing. Documentation is becoming installed.

The jupprc file wanders to a common filesdir for all joe ports,
and gets some updates and stripping.

The old joe-2.9preXXX port gets nuked.

A new port is done from scratch for joe-3.1, influencing my
fixes to the joe-2.8 port, and put into ports/editors/joe/modern
This port includes jupp and documentation as well.

It says it has utf-8 support, but I can't test that since it
thinks, then, my terminal would be utf-8 as well.
It tabcompletes within the search'n'replace dialogue. Bad.

There are two versions available:
 * classic
	The traditional joe 2.8, licenced under the GNU GPLv1.
	This version has no autoconf support and is pretty old,
	but all known security problems have been fixed. This
	version has been proven very stable for over ten years.
	There is support for not displaying control characters
	in the range from 128 to 159 to the terminal (asis-lat1).
 * modern
	This version reflects the current development of joe,
	which has started again after like six years, with
	Joe Allen himself coming back after over eight years.
	This programme uses autoconf and has utf-8 support,
	but is still work in progress.

Please test, especially bochs, snownews et al. bsd.port.mk was deliberately

@it's over, people

--
Usually, the BSD community _never_ removes credits (the MirOS COPYRIGHT
file being a pretty good example for that fact). However, the OpenBSD
people required me to remove their names from the MirPorts framework,
where it got imported to from the OpenBSD ports tree, and declared as
contributor of the port to OpenBSD. I can understand their privacy is-
sues, but still am not easy with this decision. However, I have to obey.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 ports repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This continues opening an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

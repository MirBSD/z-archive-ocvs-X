The ports/editors/jupp port wanders to ports/editors/joe/classic
and gets polishing. Documentation is becoming installed.

The jupprc file wanders to a common filesdir for all joe ports,
and gets some updates and stripping.

The old joe-2.9preXXX port gets nuked.

A new port is done from scratch for joe-3.1, influencing my
fixes to the joe-2.8 port, and put into ports/editors/joe/modern
This port includes jupp and documentation as well.

It says it has utf-8 support, but I can't test that since it
thinks, then, my terminal would be utf-8 as well.
It tabcompletes within the search'n'replace dialogue. Bad.

@joe is the professional freeware ASCII text screen editor for UNIX. It makes
full use of the power and versatility of UNIX, but lacks the steep learning
curve and basic nonsense you have to deal with in every other UNIX editor.
joe has the feel of most IBM PC text editors: The key-sequences are remi-
niscent of WordStar and Turbo-C. joe is much more powerful than those
editors, however. joe has all of the features a UNIX user should expect:
full use of termcap/terminfo, excellent screen update optimizations (joe is
fully useable at 2400 baud), simple installation, and all of the UNIX-inte-
gration features of vi. jupp has also the power of common PC DOS editors
because it uses WordStar-alike key combination codes even more.

This is an old version of joe-editor which has proven very stable over
nearly ten years; at SourceForge there is a project which tries to make
joe an up-to-date editor, but at the moment they just introduce bugs.
See ports/editors/joe/ for the newer version (http://joe-editor.sf.net).

This modification of joe has support for not displaying characters from
128 up to 159, which saves your nerves on certain terminal types.

@Add option "-asislatin" (enabled by default), which, if "-asis" (disabled
by default except for jupp(1)) is set too, restricts the as-is displaying
of characters from 128 up to 159 to none.
This will probably save your life on certain UNIX® terminals...

@Merge import of OpenBSD source, ports and XF4 tree.

While here,
o clean up differences where possible
o whitespace cleanup
o ifdef ./. if defined()
o '...' ./. "..."
o echo foo > bar ./. echo foo >bar
o `...` ./. $(...) ./. $$(...)
o `...' ./. '...'
o modernize "our" tree, e.g. WWW in ports
o fix some typos and brainos introduced when renaming OpenBSD to MirBSD
o use hardware 80387 by default
o migrate Apache 1.3.28 OpenBSD ./. MirBSD ./. KAME
o work around as many CVS bugs as possible (add back/delete files, ...)

Synchronize stuff, ready for ongoing changes.

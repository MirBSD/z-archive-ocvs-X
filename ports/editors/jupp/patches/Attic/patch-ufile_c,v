[ 10th try to commit ]

The ports/editors/jupp port wanders to ports/editors/joe/classic
and gets polishing. Documentation is becoming installed.

The jupprc file wanders to a common filesdir for all joe ports,
and gets some updates and stripping.

The old joe-2.9preXXX port gets nuked.

A new port is done from scratch for joe-3.1, influencing my
fixes to the joe-2.8 port, and put into ports/editors/joe/modern
This port includes jupp and documentation as well.

It says it has utf-8 support, but I can't test that since it
thinks, then, my terminal would be utf-8 as well.
It tabcompletes within the search'n'replace dialogue. Bad.

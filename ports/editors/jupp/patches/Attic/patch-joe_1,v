The ports/editors/jupp port wanders to ports/editors/joe/classic
and gets polishing. Documentation is becoming installed.

The jupprc file wanders to a common filesdir for all joe ports,
and gets some updates and stripping.

The old joe-2.9preXXX port gets nuked.

A new port is done from scratch for joe-3.1, influencing my
fixes to the joe-2.8 port, and put into ports/editors/joe/modern
This port includes jupp and documentation as well.

It says it has utf-8 support, but I can't test that since it
thinks, then, my terminal would be utf-8 as well.
It tabcompletes within the search'n'replace dialogue. Bad.

 .SH Editing Tasks
-.SS Basic Editing
-
-When you type characters into the editor, they are normally inserted into
-the file being edited (or appended to the file if the cursor is at the end
-of the file).  This is the normal operating mode of the editor.  If you want
-to replace some existing text, you have to delete the old text before or
-after you type in the replacement text.  The \fBBackspace\fR key can be used
-for deleting text: move the cursor to right after the text you want to
-delete and hit \fBBackspace\fR a number of times.  
-
-Hit the \fBEnter\fR or \fBReturn\fR key to insert a line-break.  For 
-example, if the cursor was in the middle of a line and you hit \fBReturn\fR, 
-the line would be split into two lines with the cursor appearing at the 
-beginning of the second line.  Hit \fBBackspace\fR at the beginning of a 
-line to eliminate a line-break.
-
-Use the arrow keys to move around the file.  If your keyboard doesn't have
-arrow keys (or if they don't work for some reason), use \fB^F\fR to move
-forwards (right), \fB^B\fR to move backwards (left), \fB^P\fR to move to the
-previous line (up), and \fB^N\fR to move to the next line (down).  The right
-and left arrow keys simply move forwards or backwards one character at a
-time through the text: if you're at the beginning of a line and
-you press left-arrow, you will end up at the end of the previous line.  The
-up and down arrow keys move forwards and backwards by enough characters so
-that the cursor appears in the same column that it was in on the original
-line.
-
-If you want to indent the text you enter, you can use the \fBTAB\fR key. 
-This inserts a special control character which makes the characters which
-follow it begin at the next TAB STOP.  TAB STOPS normally occur every 8
-columns, but this can be changed with the \fB^T D\fR command.  PASCAL and C
-programmers often set TAB STOPS on every 4 columns.
-
-If for some reason your terminal screen gets messed up (for example, if
-you receive a mail notice from biff), you can have the editor refresh the
-screen by hitting \fB^R\fR.
-
-There are many other keys for deleting text and moving around the file.  For 
-example, hit \fB^D\fR to delete the character the cursor is on instead of 
-deleting backwards like \fBBackspace\fR.  \fB^D\fR will also delete a 
-line-break if the cursor is at the end of a line.  Type \fB^Y\fR to delete 
-the entire line the cursor is on or \fB^J\fR to delete just from the cursor 
-to the end of the line.  
-
-Hit \fB^A\fR to move the cursor to the beginning of the line it's on.  Hit 
-\fB^E\fR to move the cursor to the end of the line.  Hit \fB^U\fR or 
-\fB^V\fR for scrolling the cursor up or down 1/2 a screen's worth.  
-"Scrolling" means that the text on the screen moves, but the cursor stays at 
-the same place relative to the screen.  Hit \fB^K U\fR or \fB^K V\fR to move 
-the cursor to the beginning or the end of the file.  Look at the help 
-screens in the editor to find even more delete and movement commands.  
-
-If you make a mistake, you can hit \fB^_\fR to "undo" it.  On most keyboards
-you hit just \fB^-\fR to get \fB^_\fR, but on some you might have to hold
-both the \fBShift\fR and \fBControl\fR keys down at the same time to get it.
-If you "undo" too much, you can "redo" the changes back into existence by
-hitting \fB^^\fR (type this with just \fB^6\fR on most keyboards).
-
-If you were editing in one place within the file, and you then temporarily 
-had to look or edit some other place within the file, you can get back to 
-the original place by hitting \fB^K -\fR.  This command actually returns you 
-to the last place you made a change in the file.  You can step through a 
-history of places with \fB^K -\fR and \fB^K =\fR, in the same way you can 
-step through the history of changes with the "undo" and "redo" commands.  
-
-When you are done editing the file, hit \fB^K X\fR to exit the editor.  You
-will be prompted for a file name if you hadn't already named the file you
-were editing.
-
-When you edit a file, you actually edit only a copy of the file.  So if you
-decide that you don't want the changes you made to a file during a
-particular edit session, you can hit \fB^C\fR to exit the editor without
-saving them.
-
-If you edit a file and save the changes, a "backup" copy of that file is 
-created in the current directory, with a ~ appended to the name, which 
-contains the original version of the file. 
-
-.SS Word wrap and formatting
-
-If you type past the right edge of the screen in a C language or PASCAL 
-file, the screen will scroll to the right to follow the cursor.  If you type 
-past the right edge of the screen in a normal file (one whose name doesn't 
-end in .c, .h or .p), JOE will automatically wrap the last word onto the 
-next line so that you don't have to hit \fBReturn\fR.  This is called 
-word-wrap mode.  Word-wrap can be turned on or off with the \fB^T W\fR 
-command.  JOE's initialization file is usually set up so that this mode is 
-automatically turned on for all non-program files.  See the section below on 
-the \fBjoerc\fR file to change this and other defaults.  
-
-Aside for Word-wrap mode, JOE does not automatically keep paragraphs 
-formatted like some word-processors.  Instead, if you need a paragraph to be 
-reformatted, hit \fB^K J\fR.  This command "fills in" the paragraph that the 
-cursor is in, fitting as many words in a line as is possible.  A paragraph, 
-in this case, is a block of text separated above and below by a blank line.  
-
-The margins which JOE uses for paragraph formatting and word-wrap can be set
-with the \fB^T L\fR and \fB^T R\fR commands.  If the left margin is set to
-a value other than 1, then when you start typing at the beginning of a line,
-the cursor will immediately jump to the left margin.
-
-If you want to center a line within the margins, use the \fB^K A\fR command.
-
-.SS Over-type mode
-
-Sometimes it's tiresome to have to delete old text before or after you 
-insert new text.  This happens, for example, when you are changing a table 
-and you want to maintain the column position of the right side of the table.  
-When this occurs, you can put the editor in over-type mode with \fB^T T\fR.  
-When the editor is in this mode, the characters you type in replace existing 
-characters, in the way an idealized typewriter would.  Also, \fBBackspace\fR 
-simply moves left instead of deleting the character to the left, when it's 
-not at the end or beginning of a line.  Over-type mode is not the natural 
-way of dealing with text electronically, so you should go back to 
-insert-mode as soon as possible by typing \fB^T T\fR again.  
-
-If you need to insert while you're in over-type mode, hit \fB^@@\fR.  This
-inserts a single SPACE into the text.
-
-.SS Control and Meta characters
-
-Each character is represented by a number.  For example, the number for 'A'
-is 65 and the number for '1' is 49.  All of the characters which you
-normally see have numbers in the range of 32 - 126 (this particular
-arbitrary assignment between characters and numbers is called the ASCII
-character set).  The numbers outside of this range, from 0 to 255, aren't
-usually displayed, but sometimes have other special meanings.  The number
-10, for example, is used for the line-breaks.  You can enter these special,
-non-displayed \fBcontrol characters\fR by first hitting \fB`\fR and then
-hitting a character in the range \fB@@ A B C ... X Y Z [ ^ ] \e _\fR to get
-the number 0 - 31, and ? to get 127.  For example, if you hit \fB` J\fR,
-you'll insert a line-break character, or if you hit \fB` I\fR, you'll insert
-a TAB character (which does the same thing the TAB key does).  A useful
-control character to enter is 12 (\fB` L\fR), which causes most printers to
-advance to the top of the page.  You'll notice that JOE displays this
-character as an underlined L.  You can enter the characters above 127, the
-\fBmeta characters\fR, by first hitting \fB^\e\fR.  This adds 128
-to the next (possibly control) character entered.  JOE displays characters
-above 128 in inverse-video.  Some foreign languages, which have more letters
-than English, use the meta characters for the rest of their alphabet.  You
-have to put the editor in \fBASIS\fR mode (described later) to have these
-passed untranslated to the terminal.
-
-.SS Prompts
-If you hit \fBTAB\fR at any file name prompt, joe will attempt to complete
-the name you entered as much as possible.  If it couldn't complete the
-entire name, because there are more than one possible completions, joe
-beeps.  If you hit \fBTAB\fR again, joe list the completions.  You can use
-the arrow keys to move around this directory menu and press RETURN or SPACE
-to select an item.  If you press the first letter of one of the directory
-entries, it will be selected, or if more than one entry has the same first
-letter, the cursor will jump between those entries.  If you select a
-subdirectory or .., the directory name is appended to the prompt and the new
-directory is loaded into the menu.  You can hit Backspace to go back to the
-previous directory.
-
-Most prompts record a history of the responses you give them.  You can hit
-up and down arrow to step through these histories.
-
-Prompts are actually single line windows with no status line, so you can use
-any editing command that you normally use on text within the prompts.  The
-prompt history is actually just other lines of the same "prompt file".  Thus
-you can can search backwards though the prompt history with the normal \fB^K
-F\fR command if you want.
-
-Since prompts are windows, you can also switch out of them with \fB^K P\fR
-and \fB^K N\fR.
-
-.SS Where am I?
-
-Hit \fB^K SPACE\fR to have JOE report the line number, column number, and
-byte number on the last line of the screen.  The number associated with the
-character the cursor is on (its ASCII code) is also shown.  You can have the
-line number and/or column number always displayed on the status line by
-setting placing the appropriate escape sequences in the status line setup
-strings.  Edit the joerc file for details.
-
-.SS File operations
-
-You can hit \fB^K D\fR to save the current file (possibly under a different
-name from what the file was called originally).  After the file is saved,
-you can hit \fB^K E\fR to edit a different file.
-
-If you want to save only a selected section of the file, see the section on
-\fBBlocks\fR below.
-
-If you want to include another file in the file you're editing, use \fB^K
-R\fR to insert it.
-
-.SS Temporarily suspending the editor
-
-If you need to temporarily stop the editor and go back to the shell, hit 
-\fB^K Z\fR.  You might want to do this to stop whatever you're editing and 
-answer an e-mail message or read this man page, for example.  You have to 
-type \fBfg\fR or \fBexit\fR (you'll be told which when you hit \fB^K Z\fR) 
-to return to the editor.  
-
-.SS Searching for text
-
-Hit \fB^K F\fR to have the editor search forwards or backwards for a text 
-fragment (\fBstring\fR) for you.  You will be prompted for the text to 
-search for.  After you hit \fBReturn\fR, you are prompted to enter options.  
-You can just hit \fBReturn\fR again to have the editor immediately search 
-forwards for the text, or you can enter one or more of these options: 
-
-.IP \fBb
-Search backwards instead of forwards.
-
-.IP \fBi
-Treat uppercase and lower case letters as the same when searching.  Normally
-uppercase and lowercase letters are considered to be different.
-
-.IP \fBnnn
-(where \fBnnn\fR is a number) If you enter a number, JOE searches for the 
-Nth occurrence of the text.  This is useful for going to specific places in 
-files structured in some regular manner.  
-
-.IP \fBr
-Replace text.  If you enter the \fBr\fR option, then you will be further
-prompted for replacement text.  Each time the editor finds the search text,
-you will be prompted as to whether you want to replace the found search text
-with the replacement text.  You hit: \fBy\fR to replace the text and then
-find the next occurrence, \fBn\fR to not replace this text, but to then find
-the next occurrence, \fBr\fR to replace all of the remaining occurrences of
-the search text in the remainder of the file without asking for confirmation
-(subject to the \fBnnn\fR option above), or \fB^C\fR to stop searching and
-replacing.
-
-.PP
-You can hit \fB^L\fR to repeat the previous search.  
-
-.SS Regular Expressions
-
-A number of special character sequences may be entered as search text:
-
-.IP \fB\e*
-This finds zero or more characters.  For example, if you give \fBA\e*B\fR as
-the search text, JOE will try to find an A followed by any number of characters
-and then a B.
-
-.IP \fB\e?
-This finds exactly one character.  For example, if you give \fBA\e?B\fR as
-the search text, JOE will find AXB, but not AB or AXXB.
-
-.IP \fB\e^\ \e$
-These match the beginning and end of a line.  For example, if you give
-\fB\e^test\e$\fR, then JOE with find \fBtest\fR on a line by itself.
-
-.IP \fB\e<\ \e>
-These match the beginning and end of a word.  For example, if you give
-\fB\e<\e*is\e*\e>\fR, then joe will find whole words which have the
-sub-string \fBis\fR within them.
-
-.IP \fB\e[...]
-This matches any single character which appears within the brackets.  For
-example, if \fB\e[Tt]his\fR is entered as the search string, then JOE finds
-both \fBThis\fR and \fBthis\fR.  Ranges of characters can be entered within
-the brackets.  For example, \fB\e[A-Z]\fR finds any uppercase letter.  If
-the first character given in the brackets is \fB^\fR, then JOE tries to find
-any character not given in the the brackets.
-
-.IP \fB\ec
-This works like \fB\e*\fR, but matches a balanced C-language expression. 
-For example, if you search for \fBmalloc(\ec)\fR, then JOE will find all
-function calls to \fBmalloc\fR, even if there was a \fB)\fR within the
-parenthesis.
-
-.IP \fB\e+
-This finds zero or more of the character which immediately follows the
-\fB\e+\fR.  For example, if you give \fB\e[ ]\e+\e[ ]\fR, where the
-characters within the brackets are both SPACE and TAB, then JOE will find
-whitespace.
-
-.IP \fB\e\e
-Matches a single \e.
-
-.IP \fB\en
-This finds the special end-of-line or line-break character.
-
-.PP
-A number of special character sequences may also be given in the replacement
-string:
-
-.IP \fB\e&
-This gets replaced by the text which matched the search string.  For
-example, if the search string was \fB\e<\e*\e>\fR, which matches words, and
-you give \fB"\e&"\fR, then joe will put quote marks around words.
-
-.IP \fB\e0\ -\ \e9
-These get replaced with the text which matched the Nth \fB\e*\fR, \fB\e?\fR,
-\fB\e+\fR, \fB\ec\fR, \fB\e+\fR, or \fB\e[...]\fR in the search string.
-
-.IP \fB\e\e
-Use this if you need to put a \fB\e\fR in the replacement string.
-
-.IP \fB\en  
-Use this if you need to put a line-break in the replacement string.
-.PP
-Some examples:
-
-Suppose you have a list of addresses, each on a separate line, which starts 
-with "Address:" and has each element separated by commas.  Like so: 
-
-Address: S. Holmes, 221b Baker St., London, England
-
-If you wanted to rearrange the list, to get the country first, then the 
-city, then the person's name, and then the address, you could do this:
-
-Type \fB^K F\fR to start the search, and type:
-
-\fBAddress:\e*,\e*,\e*,\e*\e$\fR 
-
-to match "Address:", the four comma-separated elements, and then the end of 
-the line.  When asked for options, you would type \fBr\fR to replace the 
-string, and then type:
-
-\fBAddress:\e3,\e2,\e0,\e1\fR
-
-To shuffle the information the way you want it. After hitting return, the 
-search would begin, and the sample line would be changed to: 
-
-Address: England, London, S. Holmes, 221b Baker St.
-
-
-.SS Blocks
-
-If you want to move, copy, save or delete a specific section of text, you 
-can do it with highlighted blocks.  First, move the cursor to the start of 
-the section of text you want to work on, and press \fB^K B\fR.  Then move 
-the cursor to the character just after the end of the text you want to 
-affect and press \fB^K K\fR.  The text between the \fB^K B\fR and \fB^K K\fR 
-should become highlighted.  Now you can move your cursor to someplace else 
-in your document and press \fB^K M\fR to move the highlighted text there.  
-You can press \fB^K C\fR to make a copy of the highlighted text and insert 
-it to where the cursor is positioned.  \fB^K Y\fR to deletes the highlighted 
-text.  \fB^K W\fR, writes the highlighted text to a file.  
-
-A very useful command is \fB^K /\fR, which filters a block of text through a
-unix command.  For example, if you select a list of words with \fB^K B\fR
-and \fB^K K\fR, and then type \fB^K / sort\fR, the list of words will be
-sorted.  Another useful unix command for \fB^K /\fR, is \fBtr\fR.  If you
-type \fB^K / tr a-z A-Z\fR, then all of the letters in the highlighted block
-will be converted to uppercase.
-
-After you are finished with some block operations, you can just leave the 
-highlighting on if you don't mind it (of course, if you accidently hit \fB^K 
-Y\fR without noticing...).  If it really bothers you, however, just hit 
-\fB^K B ^K K\fR, to turn the highlighting off.  
-
-.SS Indenting program blocks
-Auto-indent mode toggled with the \fB^T I\fR command.  The
-\fBjoerc\fR is normally set up so that files with names ending with .p, .c
-or .h have auto-indent mode enabled.  When auto-indent mode is enabled and
-you hit \fBReturn\fR, the cursor will be placed in the same column that the
-first non-SPACE/TAB character was in on the original line.
-
-You can use the \fB^K ,\fR and \fB^K .\fR commands to shift a block of text 
-to the left or right.  If no highlighting is set when you give these 
-commands, the program block the cursor is located in will be selected, and 
-will be moved by subsequent \fB^K ,\fR and \fB^K .\fR commands.  The number 
-of columns these commands shift by can be set through a \fB^T\fR option.
-
-.SS Windows
-You can edit more than one file at the same time or edit two or more
-different places of the same file.  To do this, hit \fB^K O\fR, to split the
-screen into two windows.  Use \fB^K P\fR or \fB^K N\fR to move the cursor
-into the top window or the lower window.  Use \fB^K E\fR to edit a new
-file in one of the windows.  A window will go away when you save the file
-with \fB^K X\fR or abort the file with \fB^C\fR.  If you abort a file which
-exists in two windows, one of the window goes away, not the file.
-
-You can hit \fB^K O\fR within a window to create even more windows.  If you 
-have too many windows on the screen, but you don't want to eliminate them, 
-you can hit \fB^K I\fR.  This will show only the window the cursor is in, or 
-if there was only one window on the screen to begin with, try to fit all 
-hidden windows on the screen.  If there are more windows than can fit on 
-the screen, you can hit \fB^K N\fR on the bottom-most window or \fB^K P\fR 
-on the top-most window to get to them.  
-
-If you gave more than one file name to JOE on the command line, each file 
-will be placed in a different window.  
-
-You can change the height of the windows with the \fB^K G\fR and \fB^K T\fR
-commands.
-
-.SS Keyboard macros 
-
-Macros allow you to record a series of keystrokes and replay them with the 
-press of two keys.  This is useful to automate repetitive tasks.  To start a 
-macro recording, hit \fB^K [\fR followed by a number from 0 to 9.  The 
-status line will display (Macro n recording...).  Now, type in the series of 
-keystrokes that you want to be able to repeat.  The commands you type will 
-have their usual effect. Hit \fB^K ]\fR to stop recording the macro.  Hit 
-\fB^K\fR followed by the number you recorded the macro in to execute one 
-iteration of the key-strokes.   
-
-For example, if you want to put "**" in front of a number of lines, you can 
-type:
-
-\fB^K [ ^A ** \fR<down arrow> \fB^K ]\fR
-
-Which starts the macro recording, moves the cursor to the beginning of the 
-line, inserts "**", moves the cursor down one line, and then ends the 
-recording. Since we included the key-strokes needed to position the cursor 
-on the next line, we can repeatedly use this macro without having to move 
-the cursor ourselves, something you should always keep in mind when 
-recording a macro.
-
-If you find that the macro you are recording itself has a repeated set of
-key-strokes in it, you can record a macro within the macro, as long as you
-use a different macro number.  Also you can execute previously recorded
-macros from within new macros. 
-
-
-.SS Repeat
-You can use the repeat command, \fB^K \e\fR, to repeat a macro, or any other
-edit command or even a normal character, a specified number of times.  Hit
-\fB^K \e\fR, type in the number of times you want the command repeated and
-press \fBReturn\fR.  The next edit command you now give will be repeated
-that many times.
-
-For example, to delete the next 20 lines of text, type:
-
-\fB^K \ 20\fR<return>\fB^Y\fR
-
-.SS Rectangle mode
-Type \fB^T X\fR to have \fB^K B\fR and \fB^K K\fR select rectangular blocks
-instead of stream-of-text blocks.  This mode is useful for moving, copying,
-deleting or saving columns of text.  You can also filter columns of text
-with the \fB^K /\fR command- if you want to sort a column, for example.  The
-insert file command, \fB^K R\fR is also effected.
-
-When rectangle mode is selected, over-type mode is also useful
-(\fB^T T\fR).  When over-type mode is selected, rectangles will replace
-existing text instead of getting inserted before it.  Also the delete block
-command (\fB^K Y\fR) will clear the selected rectangle with SPACEs and TABs
-instead of deleting it.  Over-type mode is especially useful for the filter
-block command (\fB^K /\fR), since it will maintain the original width of the
-selected column.
-
-.SS Tag search
-If you are editing a large C program with many source files, you can use the 
-\fBctags\fR program to generate a \fBtags\fR file.  This file contains a 
-list of program symbols and the files and positions where the symbols are 
-defined.  The \fB^K ;\fR command can be used to lookup a symbol (functions, 
-defined constants, etc.), load the file where the symbol is defined into the 
-current window and position the cursor to where the symbol is defined.  
-\fB^K ;\fR prompts you for the symbol you want, but uses the symbol the 
-cursor was on as a default.  Since \fB^K ;\fR loads 
-the definition file into the current window, you probably want to split the 
-window first with \fB^K O\fR, to have both the original file and the 
-definition file loaded.  
-
-.SS Shell windows
-Hit \fB^K '\fR to run a command shell in one of JOE's windows.  When the
-cursor is at the end of a shell window (use \fB^K V\fR if it's not),
-whatever you type is passed to the shell instead of the window.  Any output
-from the shell or from commands executed in the shell is appended to the
-shell window (the cursor will follow this output if it's at the end of the
-shell window).  This command is useful for recording the results of shell
-commands- for example the output of \fBmake\fR, the result of \fBgrep\fRping
-a set of files for a string, or directory listings from \fBFTP\fR sessions. 
-Besides typeable characters, the keys ^C, Backspace, DEL, Return and ^D are
-passed to the shell.  Type the shell \fBexit\fR command to stop recording
-shell output.  If you press \fB^C\fR in a shell window, when the cursor is
-not at the end of the window, the shell is \fBkill\fRed.
-
-.SH \fBEnvironment\ variables 
-
-For JOE to operate correctly, a number of other environment settings must be 
-correct.  The throughput (baud rate) of the connection between the computer 
-and your terminal must be set correctly for JOE to update the screen 
-smoothly and allow typeahead to defer the screen update.  Use the \fBstty 
-nnn\fR command to set this.  You want to set it as close as possible to 
-actual throughput of the connection.  For example, if you are connected via 
-a 1200 baud modem, you want to use this value for \fBstty\fR.  If you are 
-connected via 14.4k modem, but the terminal server you are connected to 
-connects to the computer a 9600 baud, you want to set your speed as 9600 
-baud.  The special baud rate of 38400 or \fBextb\fR is used to indicate that 
-you have a very-high speed connection, such as a memory mapped console or an 
-X-window terminal emulator.  If you can't use \fBstty\fR to set the actual 
-throughput (perhaps because of a modem communicating with the computer at a 
-different rate than it's communicating over the phone line), you can put a 
-numeric value in the \fBBAUD\fR environment variable instead (use \fBsetenv 
-BAUD 9600\fR for csh or \fBBAUD=9600; export BAUD\fR for sh).  
-
-The \fBTERM\fR environment variable must be set to the type of terminal
-you're using.  If the size (number of lines/columns) of your terminal is
-different from what is reported in the TERMCAP or TERMINFO entry, you can
-set this with the \fBstty rows nn cols nn\fR command, or by setting the
-\fBLINES\fR and \fBCOLUMNS\fR environment variables.
-
-JOE normally expects that flow control between the computer and your
-terminal to use ^S/^Q handshaking (I.E., if the computer is sending
-characters too fast for your terminal, your terminal sends ^S to stop the
-output and ^Q to restart it).  If the flow control uses out-of-band or
-hardware handshaking or if your terminal is fast enough to always keep up
-with the computer output and you wish to map ^S/^Q to edit commands, you can
-set the environment variable \fBNOXON\fR to have JOE attempt to turn off
-^S/^Q handshaking.  If the connection between the computer and your terminal
-uses no handshaking and your terminal is not fast enough to keep up with the
-output of the computer, you can set the environment variable \fBDOPADDING\fR
-to have \fBJOE\fR slow down the output by interspersing PAD characters
-between the terminal screen update sequences.
-
-.SH Filenames
-Wherever JOE expects you to enter a file name, whether on the command line
-or in prompts within the editor, you may also type:
-
-.IP \fB!command
-Read or write data to or from a shell command.  For example,
-use \fBjoe '!ls'\fR to get a copy of your directory listing to edit or from
-within the editor use \fB^K D !mail jhallen@@world.std.com\fR to send the
-file being edited to me.
-
-.IP \fB>>filename
-Use this to have JOE append the edited text to the end of the file 
-"filename." 
-
-.IP \fBfilename,START,SIZE
-Use this to access a fixed section of a file or device.  \fBSTART\fR and
-\fBSIZE\fR may be entered in decimal (ex.: 123) octal (ex.: 0777) or
-hexadecimal (ex.: 0xFF).  For example, use \fBjoe /dev/fd0,508,2\fR to edit
-bytes 508 and 509 of the first floppy drive in Linux.
-
-.IP \fB-
-Use this to get input from the standard input or to write output to the
-standard output.  For example, you can put joe in a pipe of commands:
-\fBquota -v | joe - | mail root\fR, if you want to complain about your low
-quota.
 
+This section has been stripped because the key combinations described in
+the original manual page have all been remapped for jupp.
 
 .SH The\ joerc file
-\fB^T\fR options, the help screens and the key-sequence to editor command
+\fB^O\fR options, the help screens and the key-sequence to editor command
 bindings are all defined in JOE's initialization file.  If you make a copy
-of this file (which normally resides in \fB/usr/local/lib/joerc\fR) to
-\fB$HOME/.joerc\fR, you can customize these setting to your liking.  The
+of this file (which normally resides in \fB/etc/joe/jupprc\fR) to
+\fB$HOME/.jupprc\fR, you can customize these setting to your liking.  The
 syntax of the initialization file should be fairly obvious and there are
 further instruction in it.
